For over 15 years, Molly diligently served the public as a teller.Â  She dedicated 10 years at First Hardin National Bank, where she worked tirelessly to ensure the financial well-being of others.While Molly\u0027s career was remarkable, it only scratched the surface of her incredible character and passions. Cats held a special place in Molly\u0027s heart; she carried an immense love for felines and made it her duty to rescue as many as possible. Countless animals found solace in her care and were fortunate enough to experience all-encompassing love. Her nurturing spirit never faded and will be deeply missed by the feline friends she left behind.Genealogy also captivated Molly\u0027s interest; delving into family connections brought her great joy. She spent countless hours poring over historical records and tracing family branches that had long been forgotten. Through her dedication to genealogy, Molly strengthened familial bonds and built bridges that spanned generations. Her passion for connecting relatives was truly remarkable.Molly was predeceased by her beloved husband Karl R. Studenroth in 1980 along with three sisters and three brothers. She cherished the memories they made together throughout their married life and carried their legacy within her heart.Left to cherish their memories are those whom Molly held dear. Her son, Karl Studenroth, will forever carry his mother\u0027s love with him, taking solace in the countless memories they shared; two sisters; and three brothers.Â  Molly\u0027s impact reached far beyond her immediate family, touching the lives of extended family members and close friends who will remember her warm smile and unwavering support.Molly Lindsey Studenroth lived a life filled with love and a dedication to her passions. Her compassion for animals, commitment to the community, and zeal for genealogy were guiding forces that brought joy to all those fortunate enough to know her. As we bid farewell to this remarkable woman, let us be comforted by the fact that her spirit lives on through the lives she touched and the everlasting memories she created. To celebrate her life, a memorial service is being planned for next spring.May Molly\u0027s soul find eternal rest as she reunites with loved ones who have gone before her.

  "obituary_text": "William Charles âChuckâ Drake, age 58, of Yukon, OK, passed away on Thursday, July 6, 2023 in Oklahoma City from complications related to pneumonia.He is preceded in death by his grandmother, Lola King, grandfather, Virgil King, and uncle, Dean King. He leaves behind his wife, Cheryl, and three children, Ashley, Megan, and Justin. He also leaves behind his mother, Lawana King Bray, father, Danny George (Sharry), and brother, Joe (Valerie). Chuck was a family man and made an effort to spend time with all of his extended family: his parents-in-law, Ed and Sharon Turk of Chandler, sisters-in-law Debbie (Glen) and Vicky (Paul), step siblings David (Kim) and Marjorie (Adam), nieces Jessica (Blain), Devin, Rebecca, Alexis, and Elizabeth (Larry), and nephews Micah (Ashley), Andrew (Charlotte), and Caden.Chuck was a loyal husband, loving father, devoted son, and avid hunter and fisherman. He was born on July 24, 1964 in Cushing, OK. He graduated from Grace Christian Academy in Oklahoma City. Chuck met his beloved wife, Cheryl Turk Drake, formerly of Chandler, while working as an armored guard for a bank in downtown Oklahoma City, where Cheryl worked in the vaults. He would always bring her candy before finally asking to see her outside of work. They married on August 7, 1993. As they welcomed their three children, Chuck was committed to teaching his children, nieces and nephews, and any who wanted to learn a love of fishing and the outdoors. For many years, he was involved in an annual fishing derby for kids, where he would convince novice anglers that they should kiss the worm for good luck, and he also competed semiprofessionally in bass fishing tournaments with his fishing partner, Roy Fryer. Each year, he took a trip to visit his friend Cecilâs cabin in McAlester, OK with at least one of his children, where they hunted and made lifelong friends and memories. Chuck worked at Tinker Air Force Base as a third generation civilian mechanic for 25+ years, first as an aircraft electrician on B-52s, and later as an aircraft analyst. Whenever groups visited for tours, Chuck was the person who showed them around with great pride and humorous storytelling. But wherever he was, the topics he could talk about the most about were his pride regarding his wife and children, and, usually, whatever bass fishing tournament in which heâd recently participated.Chuck is remembered as a generous friend who gave all that he could; he could be counted on to lend a helping hand for household projects and keep you entertained with a long, humorous story after he finished it. In his last act of generosity, Chuck was an organ donor, and even in death is giving someone else a chance at life. In all facets of his life, Chuck leaves behind a legacy of humor, hard work, generosity, and loyalty.Visitation will be held on Monday, July 10 from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. at Buchanan Funeral Service, and Tuesday, July 11 from 11:00 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. at New Heights Baptist Church. Services will be held immediately following the Tuesday visitation at the church. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to Casts for Kids, a charity that teaches children with special needs to fish.",

As a kid, Stephen loved the great outdoors, riding his bike, and hanging out (or getting into trouble) with his brothers and friends. At age 16, Stephen was paralyzed from the chest down, as a result of an accident. He never let it define who he was or wanted to be in life. Stephen continued his love of fishing and hunting at the family farm. Even with his challenges, he was still able to shoot the largest deer in the field. Stephen always found a way to make people laugh with his quick jokes and his infectious smile which would always brighten the room. Family was very important to him, as he enjoyed the many family gatherings and quality time with everyone, accompanied by his English bulldog and faithful companion, Gus. He also really enjoyed spoiling his niece and nephew.

  "obituary_text": "ObituaryIt is with profound sadness that the McNulty family shares the news of the passing of Emily, their familyâs matriarch, mother, âGlam-maâ, great âGlam-maâ, aunt, godmother and treasured friend to so many, in the early morning hours of Monday, June 26th. She was 98 years old (1925-2023). Emily truly lived a life well lived.Born by a mid-wife at home (often common in 1925), she was the daughter of George and Anna Gago who had immigrated from Czechoslovakia. Not many can say this, but Emily lived her entire 98 years within a 50 block radius in the greater Milwaukee area. Always impeccably dressed and coifed with a keen sense of style in fashion and home decorating, her French twist hairstyle was her signature.She was a graduate of the class of 1939 from St. Michaelâs Grade School. St. Michaelâs perhaps has one of the most active and well run alumni programs in the country (remember this is a grade school!). Emily was passionately active in running key year reunions for her class, even hosting the 70th in her home and garden.Emily had many fond memories and again established lifelong friendships when she attended Holy Angels Academy, graduating with the class of 1943. Once again, she used her creative talents to spearhead the reunions to ensure they were well orchestrated with eye catching invitations, angel name tags, programs and centerpieces.Emily was honored to be awarded 1 of the 7 Boston Store Retail College Scholarships, assisting her to attend Marquette University. She was so proud to represent Marquette University on the Boston Store College Travel Bureau reception committee, modeling for their fashion shows and working as an assistant buyer in Better Sportswear. She earned her BA in Business Administration in 1948. At Marquette, she met the love of her life and future husband of 53 years, Truman Quentin McNulty, who she fondly referred to as âTru-heartâ. His exceptional ballroom dancing skills and many MU mixers sealed the deal. She had a storybook wedding in 1950, with her wedding dress from Hixonâs, reception in the Imperial Grand Ballroom of the Pfister Hotel, a full orchestra and 300 in attendance.Family was everything to Emily. She provided her children/grandchildren with guidance, discipline, strength, family values, work ethic and was supportive of their dreams. 110% of her focus was on her husband and raising her children, Mark, Mary Kay, Brian, and Erin. She was often teased for having the perfectly planned Catholic family, having them two years a part.! Her career became roles, such as scout den mother of Pack 56, Den 7, supreme hostess of countless elaborately decorated themed birthday parties for the children, Marquette High School Motherâs Guild, DSHA Parentâs Club, and more. On her husbandâs side, a member of Milwaukee Lawyerâs Wives (hosting May 1 Law Day for new USA citizens), State Bar of Wisconsin and ABA Lawyerâs Wives, board member of Marquette University Association of Women, and hosted the MU âDinner for 12 Strangersâ that brought new students and faculty together. She also devoted time to two Wauwatosa Womenâs Clubs, was a lifetime member of the Christ Child Society and Slovak Catholic Sokols Wreath 93. Always very proud of her 100% Slovak heritage. She was a consummate host to home dinner parties, Washington Highlandâs newcomer parties, coffees for various political candidates, and too many more to mention.What was truly remarkable about Emily was her wide range of friends from all backgrounds and ages, sometimes 25 years her junior to 20 years her senior, who came to her for advice, decorating tips, recipes, serving dishes, party planning decorations, etc. She was even nominated by a young, just married lawyer for the Milwaukee Journal Best Cook on the Block publication.Emily always said she lived a charmed life. A travel agent friend of her once told her âYou are not considered well traveled until you book passage on the QE-2, fly the Concorde and ride the Orient Express.â Emily accomplished all 3. She treasured her two trips to her motherâs home village in Slovakia, once with her mother and 25 years later with her daughter. One of her cherished memories was attending the Presidential Inauguration and Ball in Washington DC.Emilyâs last years were graced by the immeasurably compassionate care and loving, loyal and constant support of Betty V. Heartfelt thanks to the other caregivers who also supported Emily on her final journey. They all were instrumental in allowing her to stay in the Highlandâs home she treasured since 1971.Just a glimpse into the life of a 98 year old woman who gave so much to so many for them to succeed and enjoy life.Emily is reunited in heaven with her husband Truman (2004), daughter Erin (2010), son Mark (2019), brother Rudy Gago (1983) and her faithful canine companion Riley (2021). She leaves to celebrate her life her devoted daughter Mary Kay of San Francisco, loving son Brian (Luanne) of Green Bay, cherished grandchildren Natalie Bowling (Scott), Kelly, Brigette and Sam and great-grandson Ace Bowling, along with many other relatives and friends. Visitation for Emily will be on Friday, July 7th from 4 PM â 7 PM at Wisconsin Memorial Park, Chapel of the Chimes, 13235 W. Capitol Dr. Brookfield. Mass will be on Saturday, July 8th at 12 Noon, with eulogies at 11:50 AM, at St. Sebastian Catholic Church, 5400 W. Washington Blvd., Milwaukee. Private interment.Contributions to the Truman \u0026 Emily McNulty Scholarship and Award Fund at Marquette University Law School (Checks may be made payable to Marquette University Law School, with McNulty Fund written in the memo line. Please mail checks to Marquette University, PO Box 7013, Carol Stream, IL 60197-7013.) or the Wisconsin Humane Society (4500 West Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53208) requested.Mom, you are now reunited with dad and enjoying a ballroom dance that will last an eternity.

  "obituary_text": "On Sunday, February 5th, Stanley M âSTANâ Stark of 1628 Courthouse Rd left this earth to once again join his loving wife Wanda in eternal embrace.Stanley was born on August 16th, 1939, in Brattleboro, Vermont to Malcolm and Stella Stark. Born a few years before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Stanley and his family moved several times during his childhood. World War II was on, and Malcolm Stark moved his family from Vermont to Massachusetts, Topsham Maine, and Washington tate in search of work. Shortly after the war, Stanley and his family returned to Maine.Stanley spent his remaining childhood in small, rural New England where he developed an unmatched work ethic logging in the woods of Maine while employed at his fathersâ sawmill.Stanley graduated from Appleton High School and enlisted in the United States Navy in 1957. This would be the beginning of a remarkable military career that saw Stanley serving his country in Europe, Africa, the Indian Ocean, and Vietnam. During his impeccable military career Stanley rose to the rank of Master Chief Petty Officer, the highest rank afforded to enlisted personnel. It was during his first tour of duty in Naples, Italy, that Stan would meet and fall in love with his beloved wife Wanda. For 58 years Stan and Wanda would build an unshakeable marriage that would lead them on adventures across the world and see them raise three children. Stan and Wanda exemplified complete and total love, joy, and commitment. This wonderful bond would live on well beyond Wandasâ passing in 2018.In recent years, Stan discovered his passion for salt and freshwater kayaking. Stan competed in many races throughout the Southeast and loved paddling with his new group of friends.The older, wiser Stan was dubbed the âZenmasterâ by his new-found brotherhood. In July of 2020, Stan embarked on his dream of paddling the entire length of the Mississippi River. What appeared to be an âimpossible dreamâ that began in a tiny town in Minnesota ended some 2500 miles later in the Gulf of Mexico as Stanley became the oldest man in history to accomplish this feat at 81 years of age. For those who knew Stan, none were surprised. He loved the bond he formed with these men and women with whom he shared the winding rivers.Stanley leaves behind two brothers, James Stark and Malcolm Stark Jr. Stan also leaves a sister, Molly Leigher and was pre-deceased by sister Nancy Turner.Of all the many achievements and accomplishments that Stanley Stark was credited with, there are none greater than having been a devoted husband to his wife, adoring grandfather to his three grandchildren, Marty, Sam and Haley, and an amazing father to his three children. Stanley leaves behind two daughters, Linda Baker and her husband Kelly Baker and Ada Stewart and her husband James Stewart, both from Gulfport and a son, Larry Stark, and his wife Diana Stark from Maine.Dad, we love you and canât imagine a better father and role model. Simply put, Stan Stark made everyone he came in contact with a better person for knowing him.Your soul is free to join your darling Wanda and free to paddle greater waters.Friends are invited to join the family for visitation and services on Saturday, February 11, 2023, at Riemann Family Funeral Home, 11280 Three Rivers Road, Gulfport. Visitation will be held from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m., with the Funeral Service at 11:00 a.m. Mr. Stark will be laid to rest at Floral Hills Memorial Gardens in Gulfport.",

  "obituary_text": "Clifford John Palacio was born and partially raised in Seine Bight, a quintessential Garifuna village in Belize. Â Born on May 6, 1930, Clifford John Palacio was the eldest son of Santiaga and Fulgencio Palacio. He attended school under one of Belize\u0027s most outstanding Garifuna teachers, Simeon M. Sampson, Sr. (a.k.a. Master Bam). After Cliffordâs father returned from Scotland during World War II in 1942, at the age of fifteen, his family moved from Seine Bight to Dangriga Town where he continued his elementary education at Sacred Heart School managed by the Sisters of the Holy Family.Â In 1946, when Primary School Certificate examination was first introduced in Belize by the Colonial Education Department, young Clifford passed the test qualifying him to become a pupil (student) teacher. On January 13, 1947, Clifford\u0027s teaching career officially began. At the age of nineteen, together with then Garifuna student-teachers Eugene Hernandez, Augustine Flores, and George Guerrero, he attended St. John\u0027s College (high school) under a Jesuit Mission teacher-training scholarship program initiated by late Fr. John M. Knopp S.J., Superior. (Those were part of the Garifuna cream-of-the-crop historically selected and trained for missionary work in rural Belize.)Â While in St. John\u0027s College (high school.), together with Theodore Palacio, Austin Flores, Eugene Hernandez and Govel Morgan, Clifford Palacio assisted in the compilation of a Garifuna dictionary headed by seminarian John Stochl, S.J. It was the first of its kind ever published in Belize in 1951. The same group of Garifuna students also produced a Catholic prayer book titled \"Lebeneri Cielu\" --The Gate of Heaven.Â Cliffordâs remarkable class was the first group to graduate from LandÃ­var Campus the new location of St. Johnâs College. Some members of that student body became prominent public figures of the country. Hon. Curl Thompson became Deputy Prime Minister under the administration of former Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel. Eustace Usher became chief radio announcer of Government Radio Belize. For many years, Charles Woods headed the Labor Department of Belize. Johnny Price became a medical doctor. From Yo Creek, Guadalupe Pech became a politician and held the post of Minister of Education under the administration of Hon. George Cadle Price. Santiago Perdomo also entered politics and became a Minister of government. Â Paul Lewis created history by becoming the first principal of Lynam College in Dangriga Town, while Eugene Hernandez held the post of first principal of Muffles College in Orange Town in 1953. This was the first time in the history of Belize that high school education became available to students outside of Belize City.Â  For fifteen years, Augustine Flores was principal of Ecumenical College in Dangriga Town. Oswald Reyes was ordained a Roman Catholic priest.Â Over the years, Mr. Palacio accumulated a wealth of experiences as a teacher, as a Garifuna activist and as an effective leader. After graduating from S.J.C. in 1953, Clifford, having passed the First Class Teachers\u0027 Exam while still in high school taught in San Jose Palmar, a one-teacher school, one year after pioneer Eugene Hernandez started Muffles College, Orange Walk Town. He later attended St. John\u0027s Teacher Training College for two years.In 1955 he married his high-school sweetheart Rita Servio, then a student-teacher. This union produced nine wonderful children, six boys and three girls. Rita, a trained teacher and a Child Development Specialist with the State of California, stood firmly by her husband quietly raising and harmoniously educating their nine successful children. Their careers as a team, teaching in rural Belize, started in San Pedro, Ambergris Caye immediately after their honeymoon. Both Rita and Clifford are multilingual, fluent in Garifuna, Spanish, English, Creole and Clifford some Maya.Â In 1970 Mr. Palacio migrated to the United States with the aim of providing for his family the opportunity to acquire a college education. One of the girls earned a Ph. D in Instructional technology from USC and another girl earned an M.B.A. from the Catholic University of America; one of the boys played professional basketball with the N.B.A. and Overseas for ten years; one boy is a computer technician. One of the boys is a respiratory therapist. One of the girls is a cosmetologist and healthcare caregiver. One of the boys was a supervisor with AT\u0026T, now an entrepreneur and another boy, with varied skills is a Garifuna artist, a painter and a master drummer. He is also a composer having released some songs. One of the boys was a tool designer in the airplane manufacturing industry, now retired.Â In 1973, Mr. Palacio joined the Garifuna Settlement Day Committee of Los Angeles. During the time he was secretary and president for sixteen years, he initiated and promoted several trends (Garifuna traditions) in Los Angeles, such as, nine-day-novena culminating in a beluria, Garifuna Mass prayers and hymns, outdoor Garifuna drumming and dancing, annual Settlement Day celebrations, annual dinner dance, yearly excursions from Dangriga, radio program, annual presentation of young Miss Garifuna to the Los Angeles City Council Meeting, Miss Garifuna pageant and traditional Christmas grand ball. This is one of the traditions that our ancestors brought with them from Yurumein in the eighteenth century.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In connection with the promotion and preservation of the Garifuna culture and history, Clifford established contacts with several universities, such as, Columbia University, Stanford University, UCLA, USC, Irvine University, Maryland University and Texas A\u0026M - Commerce University.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  After working for thirteen years as an ESL (English as a Second Language) Instructor with Center for Employment Training, Mr. Palacio retired in July of 1997. But his love for teaching did not allow him to stay away all together from classroom teaching and sharing his experiences and knowledge. As a retiree, he got engaged in the teaching of Garifuna history and language pro bono. November 1st, 1999 marked the anniversary of the beginning of an era in the Garifuna history -- the formal study of the Garifuna unique history and language in Los Angeles, California. Clifford\u0027s wish was, someday, to have Garifuna history and language taught in all predominant Garifuna communities in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.Â Viewing :Friday, August 5, 2022Â 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.Holy Cross Mortuary :Room D5835 West Slauson AvenueCulver City, CA 90230Celebrants:Bishop David G.

From his years spent with the Whoodoo Men, playing alongside Josh Boyd and the VIP Band, to his most recent adventure with the Fabulous Disaster, he put everything he had into his music.Tom was most proud of his family. He was very much involved in his grandchildrenâs lives, supporting their passions whether it was football, BMX, dirt bikes, go-karts, or most recently the enlistment of his oldest grandson into the Army National Guard.

  "obituary_text": "Hazel F. LeeMay 5, 1930-November 22, 2021Hazel Florence Webb was born in Los Angeles to Walter J. Webb (1894-1989) and Jessie A. (Anstiss) Webb (1898-1973). She passed away in Portland, Oregon.Just before her fourth birthday, Hazelâs parents negotiated a sight-unseen property swap with folks in Mosier, Oregon. Soon after, the family relocated to the small town in the Columbia River Gorge. The Webb family lived in several places in Mosier, most famously the big yellow house on 4th Ave., with 54 steep steps leading to the front door. Hazel cherished her childhood in Mosier. She attended Mosier grade school and high school.During her senior year, Hazel met the love of her life, Odell F. Lee, from Hood River. They married on June 19, 1948, shortly after Hazelâs graduation. Odell and Hazel made their first home together in Veneta, Oregon. With Odellâs carpentry skills and Hazelâs creative eye, they refurbished a small structure into a cozy home where they lived for several years. In May 1950, son Gary was born, joined by another son, Steven, in August 1951. After Veneta, Hazel and Odell moved to Portland, living first on SE Flavel Street, then on NE Wasco Street. In February 1956, son Robert was born, followed by son Pat in June 1959. The Wasco Street residence was small, and with four boys, the family needed more room. In the early â60s, Odell made a deal to have a house moved to their Wasco Street property, greatly expanding the familyâs living space. Hazel was so excited, and to the boys, it was a grand event. At this time, there were other family members living on Wasco Street as well. It was a happy place to live and raise a family. It was also not too far from Mosier, and the family traveled there often to reminisce and tell stories. After 15 or so years on Wasco Street, Hazel and Odell moved to NE 160th Street in Portland, in 1971. Hazel was still residing in this home at the time of her passing.Hazel was a woman of abundant talents and numerous accomplishments, mostly self-taught and many stemming out of necessity. She was an excellent seamstress, and sewed her boysâ school shirts, made fancy square dancing dresses, and created a beautiful wedding dress for a daughter-in-law. She made adorable dolls, stuffed toys and quilts for grandchildren. She was a phenomenal baker and cookâthere were always baked goodies on hand for visitors, and her Christmas treats were legendary. Hazel was an exquisite gardener and had a natural green thumb. She tended to the loveliest roses, raised the tastiest raspberries and grew from seed all the flowers used at a sonâs wedding reception. She liked to take trips to gather rocks, which she used to build walls and ponds in her beautiful yardâshe could tell you where every rock came from! Hazel was a whiz at budgeting and at running a household, making every penny count and skillfully stretching resources, while maintaining a loving, nurturing home.Hazel enjoyed many things, including camping trips, doll collecting, antiquing and simply sitting in her garden, where you could usually find her on a sunny day. In retirement, Hazel and Odell built a garden railroad that was so impressive, it drew visitors from all over the world. They were even filmed for television. Most of all, Hazel enjoyed her family; they were her pride and joy. She delighted in every visit, phone call, letter and Facebook interaction.Hazel was predeceased by her parents, her husband, her brother Walter Webb, sister Gladys Roberts, and grandson Austin Lee. She is survived by her four sons Gary (Jonette), Steven (Sharon), Robert, Patrick (Melody); nine grandchildren Michele Lanter (Brandon), Justin Lee (Jenifer), Brandon Lee (Allyson), Cassandra Locke (Aaron), Stephanie Mahaffey, Carson Lee, Dallas Lee, Bryce Lee, Collin Lee; and seven great-grandchildren Chase Bross, Madeline Lanter, Alexis Lee, Aiden Lee, Gabriella Locke, Eva Locke and Isla Locke. Hazel is also survived by many nieces and nephews.Hazel was an incredible daughter, sister, wife, mother, aunt, mother-in-law, and grandmother. She was the sweetest and dearest person, loved by all, and the family misses her terribly.Arrangements are under the direction of Anderson\u0027s Tribute Center (Funerals â¢ Receptions â¢ Cremations) 1401 Belmont Avenue, Hood River, Oregon 97031.

  "obituary_text": "Aleyamma Mathew, affectionately known as Santhamma by her family and friends, was born on November 25, 1952 to the late Mr. and Mrs. Thundil Mathai Thomas, Thundyil Puthen Veedu House Thatta, Kerala. She was the eldest of her family and was lovingly raised alongside her four siblings. After completing her high school diploma in 1968, she pursued a two year diploma course in Malayalam literature to become a Malayalam teacher. God, however, had a different plan and through the advice of a local priest she left home in 1971 to enroll in a nursing school in Pushpagiri Hospital Thiruvalla, Kerala. Upon completing her nursing degree, she moved to Florida in February 1975, (at the age of 22 years,) to pursue a nursing career.   Although she was raised in the Catholic tradition, her faith was challenged by a family friend who gave her a bible and encouraged her to read the New Testament for herself. Eagerly diving into the Word of God for the next six months, she quickly realized the importance of having a personal relationship with the Lord. Without hesitation, she accepted Jesus Christ as her Lord and Savior. From then on, she dedicated her life to seeking Him and doing His will. In 1977, she was baptized and maintained regular fellowship with the local baptistBaptist church in Florida.   In 1979 she moved to New York and began sincerely praying for a husband who would support and encourage her moving forward in her walk with Christ. On August 4th, 1980 she married Abraham Mathew (Raju) from Vadasserikara, Kerala. They began their married life in Bronx, New York in January 1981. As the eldest child in both of their families, they were united in their desire and responsibility to support their siblings in immigrating to the United States.   Aleyamma and Abraham were blessed with three children, Sherry, Shawn and Sheena. They lived in New York for 18 years maintaining fellowship with believers in Bronx and Rockland County. In 1998, the family moved to Houston, Texas and lived there for 20 years. After their retirement in 2018, they moved to Dallas to be close to their children and grandchildren.  Throughout her life she was dedicated to her faith and love of the Lord. She was committed to raising her children in the ways of God and was instrumental in teaching them to love the Lord and grow in their relationship in Christ. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, and the Lord extended her life for another eight blessed years where she was able to continue to witness His goodness and faithfulness. Even during her recent struggles with her cancer recurrence, she maintained her strong faith in the Lord and knew her Savior was with her every step of the way.  On August 12, 2023, Aleyamma was promoted to glory. She is survived by her husband Abraham, her daughter Sherry and husband Subi and their children Gabriel and Evelyn, her son Shawn and his wife Ashley and children Luke, Levi and Lydia and her daughter Sheena. She is also survived by her siblings Sister Karunniya, Saramma, Jose and Sicily, along with their spouses and children. She will be remembered for her dedication to her faith and reliance on the Lord. Her family eagerly awaits the day when they will be united with her again.",
