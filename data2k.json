        "obituary_text": "Alvin Kenneth \"Ken\" Loper was born to his wonderful mother, Evelyn, and father, Alvin K. Loper, on April 19, 1938, in Bridgeton, N.J. Having lost his father at a young age, Ken grew up proud of his mother's resilience and achievements as a single parent. Ken was raised as a true Jersey farm boy at heart. He loved to tell stories about his Aunt Hilda and Uncle Joe's farm and the summers that he spent there.Ken met Judith Richardson one summer while driving a bookmobile; it was instant love. Ken then went off to college in West Virginia and became an industrial arts teacher. He began his teaching career in 1964 at Millville High School in New Jersey. That year, Ken and Judy were married on Dec. 19, 1964. In the fall of 1970, Ken and Judy moved their family to Maine, where he would teach for 30 years in the Oxford Hills School District. He taught thousands of students to use all kinds of tools during his 35-year career, but the real truth is that he taught life.Ken and Judy lived in the small community of Paris Hill, where they had a wonderful life bringing up their children, loving each other and helping others while restoring a historic home. Ken was active in the Paris Hill Community Club, Paris Hill Country Club and the South Paris Congregational Church.Upon retirement, he moved to Amelia Island, Fla. He enjoyed many years volunteering in the community with the Police Auxiliary Corp of the Fernandina Police Department. As Ken spent his life improving the lives of his students and those in his communities, he also led a fulfilling life of his own. In fact, when he was faced with heart troubles and survived a near-death experience, he remarked that \"it (life) turned out to be better than I thought it would.\" This hopeful outlook inspired all that knew him.Ken and his wife, Judy, loved long walks on the beach and time together. Their lives were a true love story. Ken was a wonderful son, husband, father, grandfather, neighbor and friend.Ken's love, strength and kindness inspired many during his life. He will be sorely missed by his family, friends, and colleagues. He is survived by his loving wife, Judy; his children, Zane Loper, life partner, Tanya, Kathy Benowitz, her husband, Jeff, Gabi Cullinan and her husband, John; his grandchildren, Ellex, her husband, Jake, Kelton, Mackenzie, Devyn, Reilly, Hannah, Hitoshi and his wife, Grace.In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Police Auxiliary Corp of the Fernandina Beach Police Department.Join us for a sharing of memories on Dec. 18, 2023 from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. at the Alday Cottage, 15 N. Sixth St., Fernandina Beach, Fla.",

Nellie was born February 5th, 1928 in Havana, Cuba to the late Isaac Warszavsky and Berta Rumianik. Her beloved stepfather, the late Jaime Novomodi, always referred to her as \"the daughter of my heart\".   In 1948, she married her childhood sweetheart Sidney Shek in Havana, after Sidney had recovered from wounds he received in action during World War II in Europe.  After their wedding, Nellie and Sidney lived briefly in Brooklyn, NY and then moved to Queens Village where they raised three sons.  Theirs was a loving and joyful marriage, which ended when Sidney succumbed, in 1997, to illness related to his military service.  Nellie and Sidney's sons - Charles, a social worker, William, a veterinarian, and Mitchell, a dermatologist - credit their accomplishments to Nellie's love, hard-work and fierce determination to assure that they had opportunities not available to her in depression-era Cuba.  Nellie was fluent in three languages including her native Spanish, Yiddish learned as child and English learned after moving to America.  During her life she worked as a teacher's aide, a seamstress and a sales representative for Nina Shoes.  Nellie's lifelong devotion to her family, friends and community were legendary.  She served several terms as president of the Bell Park Jewish Center sisterhood, and she volunteered at a local hospital.  Nellie was honored on many occasions for her service to the Jewish community and in thanks for her volunteer work.  Because she was always present in times of need, Nellie will be irreplaceable as mother, grandmother, neighbor and friend.  Her everlasting humor, beauty, energy, passion, strength and love will be deeply missed by those who survive her including her sister Sarah Lehman, her sons, their wives Myroon, Jill and Norma and her grandchildren Joshua, Max, Alex, Denise and Debra.Contributions in the memory of Nellie Shek may be made to any of the following:Taub Institute Columbia University Medical CenterATTN: Dr. Richard Mayeux630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16New York, NY 10032212-305-2391https://giving.columbia.edu/giveonline/Bell Park Jewish Center231-10  Hillside AvenueQueens Village, NY 11427718- 464-9144ATTN: DEVELOPMENT DEPT.Alzheimer's Association\u00a0New York City Chapter\u00a0360 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor\u00a0New York, New York 10017http://www.alz.org/nyc/",

        "obituary_text": "Born in Collinwood, Wayne County, Tennessee, on October 12, 1931, he grew up in earshot of the planer mill. Broke his arm falling off a horse when a youngster, he learned how to swing a bat cross-handed, later to excel at golf the same way, cross-handed. He joined the Air Force in his teens and served in Okinawa during the Korean War, sending photos of the painted B-29's home to his family. He met a girl, later his wife, Syble Hunter, at the rail station while going off to war. She happened to be sending her brother off to the same conflict. They wrote during his time overseas, and fell in love as penpal wartime sweethearts. James and Syble married upon his return, and used the GI bill to graduate from the University of Tennessee in record time, working at the cheese factory to help pay some bills. Unsure whether to work for a prominent local dairy production facility in Knoxville, or go to graduate school, he embarked on his life's profession and passion teaching college students and growing up young men and women to maturity and a healthy profession in the dairy industry. He finished his Masters at the Ohio State University and decided to make a few dollars as an instructor at Mississippi State University to pay for his growing children, Dana Keith and Pamela Dawn Martin. Realizing teaching at the college level required a PhD he returned to The Ohio State University and finished, becoming the first person from Wayne County, Tennessee to hold a doctorate degree. After taking a position with the University of Georgia, he became a nationally recognized coach of the dairy products judging team, which won national titles several years in a row in dairy product judging. The leadership at South Dakota State University recognized an enthusiastic and inspiring teacher, and brought Dr Martin to Brookings, where he continued to win the dairy judging in the U.S. with a new group of students. Gaining a reputation for finding every one of his students professions in the industry, Clemson University called on this teacher, now recognized by the National Dairy Science Association and editor of the Cultured Dairy Products Journal. His beloved alma mater, Ohio State U called on him again to become department head of the Food Science and Nutrition. This time his preeminence as a liaison with industry enabled him to raise funds for a chaired professorship at Ohio State, and he became the first professor to be honored by becoming that chaired professor at Ohio State. With his elderly parents Luther and Auda ailing back in Tennessee he returned to Mississippi State to nurse his parents and his wife's during their senior years. In Starkville he rode his crazy cross-handed golf swing to several trophies in faculty golf competition, regularly taking time to travel to play golf with his son. Always devoted to the Lord, he took time to be Training Union director and a youth Sunday School teacher when his children were growing up. He was chairman of deacons at Milledge Avenue Baptist Church in Athens, Georgia when they built a new sanctuary. Upon his arrival in South Dakota the pastor that baptized him in Knoxville Tennessee, showed up on his doorstep asking for help in starting a Baptist Student Union at South Dakota State. He met with a banker in Brookings and convinced him that the Southern Baptist Convention could afford to pay for a new church and BSU building in Brookings. A husband and father who was committed to his family, he led by example in teaching his children to make family a part of their lives, even if it meant travelling long distances to make sure he was there for Chsistmas and summer vacations with his parents and extended family. He was a life-long friend and sacrificial giver who put wife and family first. He will be missed.\u00a0Dr. James H. Martin is preceded in death by his parents Auda and Luther Martin of Collinwood, Tennessee.\u00a0He is survived by his wife, Barbara Syble Martin, of Starkville, Mississippi and his children Dana Keith Martin and wife, Jaye, of Houston, TX and Pamela Burchill and her husband Thomas, of Fort Worth, TX. He is also survived by his grandchildren, Jordan James Burchill and wife Kaela of Austin, TX and Kelli Martin Chambers and husband Alex, of Houston, TX.\u00a0Visitation is scheduled for Tuesday, June 29, 2021 from 10:00-11:00 a.m. at First Baptist Church in Starkville, MS, with the funeral service immediately following.\u00a0 Burial will be in Memorial Garden Park in Starkville.You can leave the family a condolence at: www.welchfuneralhomes.com.",

Winslow and a resident of Reading for 66 years, died Thursday, August 31 at Wingate At Reading Rehabilitation Center surrounded by her family.  She was 90 years old. Doris was owner and manager for many years with Ron of Winslow's store on Haven Street, a Reading institution from 1950 to the mid-1970s.  The variety store was across from the depot, open 365 days a year and had loyal customers who relied on it for everything from newspapers, donuts and milk to soda-fountain sundaes, greeting cards, and train tickets.    Beginning in the mid-1970s, she was credit manager at Atlas Paper Co., Woburn for many years.   Doris was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana April 13, 1927, the daughter of Donald D. and Helen (Gerken) Long. She attended Defiance College for a year, where she met Ron. After their marriage, she was secretary to the president of the college before she and Ron moved east in 1950.   Doris was especially proud of her home in Reading, where she hosted simple but elegant parties for family and friends.  She also enjoyed time at the family's summer cottage on Crystal Lake, Gilmanton Ironworks, N.H., where for 60 years, she insisted on maintaining a rustic, \"camp\" feeling, reflected by the rotary telephone with a three-foot cord that was mounted on the wall.   She and Ron also spent winters for about 20 years at their condominium in Naples Fla. where their Super Bowl party was an annual event.   Doris enjoyed gardening and was an avid artist, producing dozens of paintings, many of which her family members hang proudly in their homes.  One of her favorite events was the annual party when the family gathered to make Christmas cookies.  In addition to her husband, to whom she was married for more than 69 years, she is survived by a son, Ronald A. Winslow Jr. and his wife Larkin Warren of Bethel, CT; a daughter Sandra Cronin and her husband Bruce Cronin of Dracut, MA; two grandchildren, Jeffrey Cronin and Jessica Cronin; a step-grandson, Dennis Ostermaier and his wife Leah Panlilio of New York City; a step-great grandson, Aidan Ostermaier; a sister Virginia Corsini of Lambertville, MI.; and many nieces and nephews.

She was born in Akron, Ohio on January 26, 1968, to Lawrence and Marianne Ciarrochi. Christine\u2019s earliest encounters with the horses that she would come to love throughout her lifetime came about during annual family vacations to Cook Forest State Park in northwestern Pennsylvania. Christine would later develop a passion for travel that took her to many far-flung destinations throughout the world: Thailand, Russia, Sweden, Hawaii, Italy, and France, to name but a few. Christine possessed an unquenchable zest for life and a thirst for adventure. She was a straight shooter, genuine to a fault and unafraid to let others know how deeply she cared for them. If you knew Christine, you couldn\u2019t help but get caught up in the excitement of the Next Big Thing she was planning. One of her greatest joys was developing an idea or event and making it Bigger and Better, as anyone who attended one of her Game Nights, Super Bowl parties or New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations can attest. Later in life, she found herself living in rural central Ohio, where she embraced letting her inner horsewoman run free. Though she waged a nineteen-year battle with cancer, she never let it define her or slow her down. She did more with her 54 years on this Earth than most might do with twice that time. Christine was fond of saying that all her favorite things in life had heartbeats. She possessed a big heart and managed to find room within it for anyone and everyone she cared for. She was a cherished wife to her husband, Jason, a mother to her son, Justin, and den mother to her dogs, Einy and Cinder, and her horse, Ghost. She also leaves behind her nephews Cory and Tawn (Katherine), her niece Jacqueline, her great nephews Andres and Elliot, her great nieces Kayleigh, Isabella, and Clementine and brothers Jon, Stephen, and Phillip (Zara). No less dear to her but far too numerous to name individually are her many friends, sisters, and those with whom she formed a tribe. You know who you are.A Celebration of Life will take place on Thursday August 4th at 11 AM at the Rutherford Funeral Home at Powell 450 West Olentangy Street Powell, Ohio 43065. A visitation will take place on Wednesday August 3rd from 6 PM to 8 PM, also at the funeral home. Family and friends may visit an hour prior to the service on Thursday.

In lieu of flowers, please make a donation in her name to either Feeding America (https://www.feedingamerica.org) or the National Park Foundation (https://www.nationalparks.org)Rutherford Funeral Home at Powell is honored to care for the Ciarrochi Rothrock Family.",

Born on June 24, 1914, in Philadelphia to George Kimball and Lily Gross Brown, she was preceded in death by brother Charles Gross (Thomas) Brown, and sisters Josephine Brown, Mary Louise Wildes Brown, Katherine Franklin Brown, and Violet Dudley Brown.  Oakland was the home of the Browns and their ancestors from 1757, when forebear Joseph McGeach/McGeath settled there.  In 1976, the state of Virginia awarded the Brown family a bicentennial plaque honoring their more than two centuries of ownership.The Brown family formerly maintained homes in Philadelphia and Royersford, Pennsylvania and had extensive land and railroad interests in Florida.  Hannah often related the family's arrival for the summer months from Philadelphia when she was a child at Point of Rocks, Maryland.  The train would make a special stop and let them off: Edgar Beans of Waterford met them with his horses and carriage.  Their dog, \"Uncle Dash,\" would race ahead and greet them, panting, on the front steps when they arrived.  In 1976, Hannah and her sisters closed their house in Philadelphia and retired to their Waterford farm.  The Brown siblings were remarkable for longevity.  All but an infant sister attained more than 90 years.A longtime member of St. Francis DeSales Catholic Church in Purcellville, Miss Brown taught CCD and was a member of the Women's Council.  She and her sisters were known for their love of animals:  many a stray dog and cat found its way to their door and none was turned away.  No immediate family survives.

Rich was a music aficionado with, notably, an encyclopedic knowledge of music from the 1950s-60s. Doo-wops were a clear favorite; in fact, his favorite song in the world- by the Planotones- is about singing them. Singing doo-wops brought him such joy, and when he sang at his daughter Catherine\u2019s wedding, he brought the house down. Rich\u2019s passion for music extended to many genres and musicians, though. Miles Davis, the Beatles, and Mozart were favorites; he would have a list of his top ten works for each. Rich Miller was a list maker extraordinaire. He devoured movies; yes, there is a top ten list. His favorite short story was Melville\u2019s His favorite Shakespeare play was He was a Yankees fan who had cheered for the Dodgers in his youth until the team left Brooklyn in 1957.Before his illness, he reveled in long drives on back roads without requiring maps, since in his view, he always knew the general direction and would get there eventually. Vacations were reached by car no matter the distance, and of course each journey required its own song list. He particularly loved the car rides to visit his cousins in Tennessee. Rich loved to tell stories, especially of his youth, of which at least half must have been true. He also regaled us with tales of his years as an instructor at Northern Telecom, where he worked for nearly thirty years. He was a staunch believer in standing up for justice even if you\u2019re standing alone; he was generous and kind.Originally from Jersey City, he met the love of his life in Rutherford, NJ in 1965. He and Evelyn married in 1967 and raised their daughters in Rutherford, moving to Pequannock in later years. He is predeceased by his parents, Frank and Dorothy Miller. He is survived by Evelyn, his wife of 55 years; daughters Ruth Miller and Catherine Sisco (Alonzo); and beloved granddaughter Emma Garcia-Miller. He will also be missed by his extended family and friends, including everyone in the Community of God\u2019s Love in Rutherford, of which he was a member for forty-seven years. In lieu of flowers, donations to the Parkinson\u2019s Foundation or the Lewy Body Dementia Foundation would be greatly appreciated.There will be a mass to celebrate Rich\u2019s life in the fall.",

        "obituary_text": "Susan Leigh Anderson, Ph.D, Professor Emerita of Philosophy at the University of Connecticut, passed away in her home in New Milford, CT on Saturday, July 30, 2022 of complications due to ALS.  Born November 13, 1944 in Portland, OR, the first child of Paul Lynge Smith and Viola Malm Smith,  she was 77 years old. Susan is survived by two siblings Peter Smith and Ann Duncan, as well as her husband Michael Anderson, her son Alexander Anderson, and her granddaughter Gwyneth Anderson. Susan will be interred beside her parents in Miner Cemetery,  Middletown, CT.Susan's formative years were spent in Fairfield, CT where she readily admitted her life mirrored the warm, safe world of the Dick and Jane books of mid-twentieth century America. Music was her first love.  She often recalled singing Ave Maria in a Christmas pageant at her church and she cherished an enchanting photograph of herself in full ballet costume, dancing the lead in a production of Swan Lake put on by her ballet class. Susan graduated from Fairfield's Rodger Ludlow High School in 1962 and went on to major in philosophy at Vassar College, earning her undergraduate degree in 1966.  After a year teaching mathematics at a girl's preparatory school, Susan pursued her doctorate at UCLA studying with (and receiving glowing letters from) such luminaires of philosophy and logic as Alonzo Church, Rudolf Carnap, and David Lewis. Susan's 1974 dissertation \"A Philosophical Analysis of the Phenomenon of Multiple Personalities in Connection with the Problem of Personal Identity\" was later noted, by her thesis chair John Perry, to presage Marvin Minsky's seminal Society of Mind (1986) by over a decade. A favorite professor at the University of Connecticut and member of the American Philosophical Association, Susan taught a wide variety of courses in philosophy and published extensively in the field.  She was especially pleased by a trio of volumes she wrote for the Wadsworth Philosophers Series: On Dostoyevsky, On Mill, and On Kierkegaard. These have been translated into many languages and read worldwide. She spent many summers on National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship grants with Richard Rorty at Princeton University, Roderick Chisholm at Brown University, and others.   Notably, Susan won the \"2002 Centennial Prize for Best Op-Ed Piece Published by a Philosopher,\" given by the American Philosophical Association. It draws a timely a lesson about the dangers of relativism, just after the 9/11 attacks. Susan spent the last two decades of her life championing machine ethics, a field of ethics and artificial intelligence she was instrumental in creating. Notable achievements of her National Science Foundation supported research in this field include the creation of the first machine to behave ethically- reported by Scientific American, Artificial Intelligence Journal, and the Proceedings of the IEEE- and co-editing the seminal collection of articles on the subject Machine Ethics, published by Cambridge University Press. Susan loved to travel and kept journals as well as photo books on each of the dozens of journeys she took around the globe. She was also an avid collector of beautiful things, her Victorian \"mansionette\" filled to the brim with treasures she found along the way.  And if there is any castle anywhere in the world that she did not visit, it was only because someone forgot to tell her about it. Later in life, she created her own dream tour of India, a romantic idyll of a sojourn to the precious stone inlayed Taj Mahal, an elephant ride up to Amir Fort in Jaipur, a barefoot pilgrimage to the Golden Temple of Amritsar, and an excursion to the Victorian Gothic splendors of Mumbai. It was a trip of a lifetime. On a wall of Susan's study, displayed in a place of prominence, is a letter received from yet another philosophical luminary concerning a talk that she had given:\"I'm sorry I lost sight of you Saturday noon in Portland, as I wanted to say how much I appreciated your demonstration that sane & sober discussion of explosive topics is, after all, possible.  Your rationality shone like a good deed in a naughty world.\"  -Wallace MatsonSusan was an accomplished philosopher, a respected professor, a world traveler, and a beloved daughter, sister, wife, mother, and grandmother.  She once wrote that she had \"a life that has been more wonderful than what I ever envisioned for myself.\"  The lives of those who knew and loved her have been far richer than they could have ever been without her. Susan died as she had lived, on her own terms.",

Dennis grew up on a farm with his sister Lorie and brother Gary, near Herreid, SD. Dennis liked to be outside with his brother Gary both winter and summer! His mom would find small footprints in the snow and knew they were outside playing. Dennis attended a country school for eight years. In the winters Dennis drove his brother to country school in a Model A but wrecked hitting a rock pile, then had to use the tractor. He then went to high school in Herreid and graduated in 1962. Dennis joined the National Guard in 1961 at the age of 17 as a junior in high school.This is when he met Carol (Hardcastle) his future wife at the Mobridge A&W when they pulled up in a big National Guard truck. Carol had to climb up to take the orders and they would soon become a couple and married two years later in Seattle Washington where they lived for nine years. Their son Todd was born there in 1967. The family moved back to South Dakota where he took up a new position and moved to Mobridge where Casey, Bubba (Jesse), and Kelly were born. Dennis was a skilled tradesman and instructor in asbestos removal and insulation installation.

Glenn was born in New Castle, Indiana, on March 4, 1929, to Leonard Gossage and Della (Eads) Gossage, both of whom preceded him in death.Glenn was married to Darlene (Fullmer) Gossage on February 17, 1950. He was an active member of various Baptist churches throughout his lifetime and was a member of First Baptist Church of Greenwood at the time of his death.He retired from Eli Lilly & Co. in 1991 after 39 years of service in various areas of the Financial and Accounting Departments. In addition to his work at Eli Lilly, Glenn and his wife, Darlene, were the owners and proprietors of Beech Grove Bowl from 1969 until 1975. During their ownership they were able to increase the bowling lineage by almost 50% above the previous years. Glenn also served as Chairman of the Greater Indianapolis Bowling Association during his last year of ownership. It was a \u201cfun time\u201d for both of them in meeting and getting to know many new friends through the bowling center.After 13 years of retirement, including 10 years of wintering in Florida, he and his wife returned to fulltime residency at Greenwood Village South. Then in June of 2004, life took a new turn when he joined as volunteer Board member (Treasurer) and assumed all the financial responsibilities as required for the non-profit food pantry for several years.The highlight of his later years was a golfing project to play in all 92 counties of Indiana. Along with golfing friends Paul Hammond, Bill Hurt, and Jim Pinegar, all from the same Sunday School Class at First Baptist Church of Greenwood, the project was started on September 22, 2008, by playing Antler Point in Rush County (Rushville). The project was completed when the foursome made a trip to play Hulman Links in Vigo County (Terre Haute) on July 18, 2011. The foursome became known as \u201cClub 92\u201d and Glenn got the nickname of \u201cDad\u201d since he was the eldest member of the group. Even though Glenn was the statistician and \u201caverage keeper,\u201d he could never quite keep up with the scores of the other three.He was preceded in death by his wife Darlene (Fullmer) Gossage in 2014. He is survived by their daughters, Paula S. Boone (William) of Indianapolis, Indiana and Peggy A. Votava (Glenn) of Goshen, Indiana. Grandchildren, all surviving, including Michael Boone (Jackie) of Indianapolis, Indiana, Jason Boone (Heidi) of Danvers, Massachusetts, Jonathan Boone (LoriAnne) of Whiteland, Indiana, Kristin Leasure of Chicago, Illinois and Gregory Leasure, also of Chicago, Illinois. He is also survived by seven great-grandchildren; Cody Boone and Cheyenne Boone of Indianapolis, Indiana. Joel Boone, Faith Boone, and Anna Joy Boone of Whiteland, Indiana and Parker Boone and Delaney Boone of Danvers, Massachusetts.Also surviving is a sister, Velma G. Strong of Huntsville, Alabama, and sister-in-law, Faye Templin of Baraboo, Wisconsin. He is preceded in death by his older sister, Lilian G. Greeson of Winston Salem, North Carolina.Funeral services will be held on Friday, August 5 at the First Baptist Church of Greenwood, 99 W. Main St. Greenwood, Indiana. Visitation will be held from 9:30 A.M. to 11:00 A.M. with the funeral service immediately following at 11:00 A.M. with Rev. Sean D. Holloway officiating.

He was preceded in death by his wife, Georgia-Lee Virginia (Foden) Agallianos. He is survived by his brother, Platon Agallianos, of Athens, Greece; his daughter, Helen Penelope Agallianos (Eric Johnson) of Urbana; and his wife Georgia's children, Donald Melvin (Rodica) of Surrey, England, and Susan Cronin (Benjamin Burns) of Georgia, Vermont, as well as eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.Dennis was born on January 1, 1923, in Galati, Romania, to Dionysios and Eleni (Craciun) Agallianos. His father was born in Zakynthos, Greece, and his mother was born in Romania of Greek and Romanian heritage. After attending the Greek Lyceum of Galati, he graduated with a medical degree from Victor Babes University in Cluj, Romania. In 1951, after the installation of the communist dictatorship in Romania, Dennis fled Romania for Greece. After a stay in a refugee camp on the island of Lesvos, he settled in Athens, where he practiced urology for six years. In 1957, Dennis immigrated to the United States under a program for refugees of the Cold War. Dennis lived and worked first in New York City and then in Brattleboro, Vermont, where he met his future wife Georgia-Lee and her children, Donald and Susan.Dennis and Georgia were married in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1964, and their daughter Helen was born there in 1968. Dennis, who changed medical specialties when he moved to the United States, worked as a psychiatrist at Spring Grove State Hospital in Baltimore, and then, for more than thirty years at the Brattleboro Retreat in Vermont. While in Baltimore, Dennis conducted research at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and his research was published in a number of scientific and medical journals, including Nature. Later, Dennis became an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth Medical School. In 1994, Dennis was honored with an Exemplary Psychiatrist Award from the National Alliance on Mental Illness. After retiring from the Brattleboro Retreat, Dennis worked at community mental health centers in Vermont and Massachusetts; he prided himself on having worked until age 87. He and Georgia were active members of St. George Greek Orthodox Church in Keene, New Hampshire. Georgia passed away in 2004, and in 2010, after more than forty years in Brattleboro, Dennis moved to Urbana, Illinois, to be close to Helen, her husband Eric, and their children, Theodore and Zoe. In Urbana, Dennis made himself part of the warm and welcoming communities at Clark-Lindsey Village and at Three Hierarchs Greek Orthodox Church. He made many new friends, with whom he loved discussing news, politics, history, philosophy and language. Most days he could be found at Clark-Lindsey's library. He read several newspapers a day, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and a daily Greek-language paper, and he often had a newspaper clipping at the ready for a friend or relative who he thought might be interested in a particular topic. He was a warm and generous friend and a loving and doting father and Pappou. He will be sorely missed. Memorial contributions may be made to Three Hierarchs Greek Orthodox Church. Visitation for Dennis will be held on Thursday February, 7 2019 at Three Hierarchs Greek Orthodox Church on 2010 3 Hierarchs Ct, Champaign, IL. 61820 from 10am-11am with a service to follow at 11am.

        "obituary_text": "Psalm 1:1-3Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful;Christopher Thomas Culpepper DC LPN, 51, of Maumelle, Arkansas, passed peacefully in the early morning hours of April 14, 2023. Chris was born September 9, 1971, to parents Charles and Mary Culpepper at Jefferson Regional Hospital in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.He was preceded in death by his father, Charles Culpepper, Grandparents, Rev. James and Mildred Beck of Monticello, AR, and the late Thomas Richard Culpepper and Nellie Mae Mann of Lincoln County, AR.Chris is survived by his two sons, Willem and Walden Culpepper of Little Rock, Arkansas; his mother, Mary Carolyn Beck Culpepper; his brother, Brian Culpepper and his wife Cristina Scarlat, and his niece, Clara Culpepper, of Fayetteville, Arkansas.Chris participated in many team sports such as football and baseball like many Gen X kids do and was a 1989 graduate of White Hall High School. From there, he carried the bulldog pride, fighting spirit and compassion for others into his career as a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC), serving as a compassionate caregiver to many throughout his life. He demonstrated his true bulldog grit, spirit, and determination when he battled cancer with grace and dignity over these past few years. During his lifetime, Chris helped many others regain their health and happiness with professionalism and passion. We\u2019re grateful.After high school, Chris enrolled at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville for two years covering pre-requisites before transferring into Cleveland Chiropractic College in Kansas City, MO to complete his Doctor of Chiropractic Degree in 1995. Chris was a life-long learner and resided in Little Rock, Arkansas practicing his craft. He also studied Psychology and Nutrition at the University of Central Arkansas and Pulaski Technical College and earned his Nursing LPN in December of 2014 from Baptist Health Schools in Little Rock, AR.Chris surrounded himself with good people who kept him smiling while attending music festivals and gatherings with his extended family. He lived and practiced within the Little Rock area and shared his love of sports and music with his two children early in their lives. He was quick to admit that both boys quickly surpassed his hobbyist/skill levels in both guitar playing and various team sports! Chris loved this and was so very proud of both for becoming fine, young leaders within their schools and at church.Chris was blessed with the best lifelong friends anyone could ask for and he played a starring role in many hilarious memories as they grew up in Jefferson County, Arkansas. A mid-eighties memory from White Hall\u2019s Little League Baseball season comes up frequently. Chris was always a \u2018little bit stronger\u2019 than some peers and for his age so his pitching speeds were quite prolific in those days His control of the strike zone, however, lacked the precision he later developed in his chosen profession. His best friend Georgie tells this story often, \u201cBack in one Little League baseball game, young Dr. Pep was on the pitcher\u2019s mound; hurling three consecutive speedballs into the back, ankle and the shin of opposing team batters; a concerned baseball mom yells from the bleachers, \u201c take him out, He\u2019s a killer!\u201d. Times sure have changed since the 80\u2019s, but Chris\u2019 good friends will keep that comical story and countless others alive for all who knew and loved Dr. Christopher T. Culpepper DC. Here\u2019s to being pain free, My Brother! We love you; miss you already and will keep you in our hearts and minds until we meet again. In lieu of flowers, the family would like to direct donations to: https://carti.ejoinme.org/donateMemorial service will be held 2:00 pm Saturday April 29, 2023 with the visitation a hour prior at Moore's Chapel, 206 West Center St., Fayetteville, AR 72701.",

She always allowed her children to have a menagerie of animals from dogs and cats to geese and chickens to hamsters, rabbits, and rats.   Bea worked for the Scotch Bakery in Pacific Grove for a short time and then went to work for the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District as Registrar at Seaside High School and Monterey High School until her retirement.

As mother with child, each day I grew,                                    My mind was filled with thoughts of you.                                     I'd daydream of the things we'd share,                                    Like late-night bottles and Teddy bears.                                    Like first steps and skinned knees,                                    Like bedtime stories and ABC's.                                    I thought of things you'd want to know,                                    Like how birds fly and flowers grow.                                    I thought of lessons I'd need to share,                                    Like standing tall and playing fair.                                    When I first saw your precious face,                                    I prayed your life be touched with grace.                                    I thanked the angels from above,                                   And promised you unending love.                                   Each night I lay you down to sleep.                                    I gently kiss your head and cheek.                                    I count your little fingers and toes;                                    I memorize your eyes and nose.                                    I linger at your nursery door,                                   Awed each day I love you more.                                   Through misty eyes, I dim the light,                                    I whisper, ' I love you\" every night.                                    I loved you from the very start,                                    You stole my breath, embraced my heart.

        "obituary_text": "RICHMOND, Ind. \u2013 Jerry Carl \u201cJet\u201d Jensen, age 82, of Richmond, Indiana, slipped the surly bonds of Earth on Saturday, November 20, 2021, at home surrounded by his family.Jerry was born at home on May 25, 1939, near Meriden, Iowa, to Otto and Lilly Johnson Jensen. His youth was spent on his family\u2019s farm, where he learned to do everything from milking cows and castrating piglets to plowing the fields and repairing tractors (always John Deere). Jerry grew up being very close with his many aunts, uncles, and cousins, as well as many neighbors and friends, most of who attended the local Lutheran church that was founded by his grandfather after immigrating to Iowa from Sweden. Considered tall by most, at home Jerry was the shortest man in his family at 6\u20193\u201d. After being a great student and graduating high school, he attended Buena Vista College in Storm Lake, Iowa. Although Jerry was a state champion plowman and liked farming and animals, he had a passion for aviation. As a boy, Jerry would look up at the sky when a plane flew by and comment, \u201cI\u2019ll be up there someday.\u201d Finally, deciding that a career as a pilot was the best path for him, he transferred to Spartan School of Aeronautics in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Jerry\u2019s work took him to Kettering, Ohio, where he met his future wife, LaDonna. After they married, they moved to Ypsilanti, Michigan, where their daughter, Julia, was born. They relocated to Livermore, California, in 1971. Their second daughter, Sarah, was born in 1972, but sadly only lived for a few weeks. Their third daughter, Janell, was born in 1975. In 1976, the family moved to Richmond to be near LaDonna\u2019s mother and aunts. They joined First English Lutheran Church at that time, as well. Jerry had been a highly valued member of his community in Richmond ever since.Jerry began his career flying for various cargo and then charter carriers, including Universal, Zantop, and Saturn Airways. He then flew many years with Transamerica Airlines, before becoming one of the first pilots hired by UPS as they developed their air fleet. Jerry had piloted many types of commercial aircraft, including the AW Argosy in the beginning, and flew as Captain of Douglas DC-8 and later as Captain of his favorite commercial jet to fly, the Boeing 747. He flew all over the United States, as well as to every continent in the world except Antarctica. From student to Co-Pilot to Captain, Jerry\u2019s attention to detail, intuition for the physics of flight, deep knowledge of the machinery of the aircraft, as well as his commitment to integrity and safety meant that anyone who flew with him was absolutely impressed. His careful handling meant Jerry was requested specifically to fly the champion racehorse, Secretariat, three times. He also was the right pilot to spend a month transporting devout Muslim pilgrims, who had never flown before, from rural parts of Ghana and the Ivory Coast to Mecca for the Hajj. Jerry especially enjoyed flying to Alaska, Hawaii, Germany, Hong Kong, and Japan.Additionally, Jerry flew and restored WWII-era Stearman biplanes \u2014 WWII open cockpit trainer planes\u2014with his best buddy, Jeff Jordan. He also enjoyed rebuilding them, but especially loved going to fly-ins and giving rides. Jerry was always sharing the skies with family and friends, as well as taking the planes to Hagerstown, Indiana; Oshkosh, Wisconsin; Galesburg, Illinois; or even back to Iowa. He and Jeff donated rides to many charitable organizations\u2019 fundraisers. Jerry also took many veterans for rides, including a WWII veteran who trained in a Stearman in 1942. He enjoyed meeting with his \u201cRichmond Air Force\u201d friends and was a member of Stearman Restorers Association and the EAA (Experimental Aircraft Association) Chapter 373.Jerry was a gifted mechanic. He grew up on John Deere tractors and always had at least one green-and-yellow implement on hand\u2014and had kept them all running for decades. Jerry also maintained and operated the antique cars at the Wayne County Historical Museum for years. For countless family, neighbors, and friends, he could repair any mower, tractor, car, appliance, or machine anything with a motor. Jerry enjoyed removing snow from the neighborhood every winter with his snowblower, as well.Jerry would do anything for anyone and almost never said no. He had a kind heart. Jerry always enjoyed the company of animals, much to the delight of his daughters, and welcomed a motley succession of cats, dogs, mice, ferrets, hamsters, horses, and even goldfish into the family. He was an amazing horse show dad and then a horse show grandpa. Jerry was an absolutely devoted grandpa for all his grandchildren. He was also an amazing father, excellent husband, and a valuable relative or friend to many, many people. Jerry had the most generous spirit. As one friend put it, \u201cYou could scour the whole world and not find one person who didn\u2019t like Jerry Jensen.Survivors include his daughters, Julia (Jay Smith) Jensen and Janell (Steve Sizelove) Jensen, both of Richmond; grandchildren, Jade, Rey, Hannah, and Lane; siblings, Richard Jensen and Judy (Wally Sunderland) Jensen; brother-in-law, Tom (Julia) Wratten; nieces and nephews, Jay (Katie) Byers, Boyd (Kimberly) Byers, Dan Wratten, and Robert (Cameron) Wratten; great-nieces and great-nephews; numerous cousins; and countless beloved friends.He was preceded in death by his wife of more than 53 years, LaDonna Irene Wratten Jensen, who died December 19, 2020; infant daughter, Sarah; parents; sister, Joyce Jensen Byers; and beloved dog, Coconut.Visitation for Jerry Carl \u201cJet\u201d Jensen will be from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. Friday, December 3, 2021, at First English Lutheran Church, 2727 East Main Street, Richmond.

He then went on to receive his certification at Job Corp for Facility Maintenance.Shaheed (Heedy) was more than just a man. He was a loving man, father, son, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin and friend. He had a fun spirited soul who had many passions in life. Heedy had such a welcoming spirit. As a child, he would make friends at the park and then bring them home, not even knowing their names to have them stay for dinner or spend the night.

Heedy wanted so much more out of life and devoted much time to his family to create a strong foundation for them. Heedy also enjoyed getting together with family at gatherings, eating, joking, playing games, and just having a good time creating memories. Heedy was an intelligent math whiz. He encouraged people to have a positive mindset, eat healthy, and taking care of themselves. He also loved his dogs. Before he had kids, his dogs were his kids. He was just getting into the business of breeding and training his dogs, which was successful. He had everything to live for and was looking forward to watching his family and business grow. He loved to travel seeing and learning new things. He recently just came back from Jamaica where you could see his light shining through. He also had a love for fashion always sharp with a fresh cut. Anytime a person was in need, he was always willing to help. He would say, \"I gotch you cuz\" and always fulfilled his vow. His smile and laughter could light up a room. He was genuinely a beautiful person inside and out. In his 31 years of life, Heedy has made such an impact on many lives. He will be forever missed.He is survived by his two beautiful sisters, Sherreda Johnson (Aaron Johnson), and Shakina Smith; the love of his life, Armani Harley; children, Samir Smith, Semaje' Smith, and Brooklynn Judson, whom he cared for as his own; three nieces; two nephews, and a host of relatives.He is preceded in death by his mother Muriel Smith, sister Shakira Smith, and grandmother Josephine Smith.To send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of Shaheed, please visit our floral store.",

James Patrick Cosgrove, born in Newark, N.J., on May 14, 1935, to Irish immigrants James Joseph and Mary (Lydon) Cosgrove, was a proud son of the ould sod. Jim was a tough, hard-working Teamster (Local 575); a strong, understated man who never felt he needed to be heard, yet commanded the room with his stories of Newark in the '50s and his many adventures. Similarly, he quietly guided his family, through tough times and in good ones, using his example rather than his commands. With love, kindness, patience, and faith, he taught his children, his grandchildren, and those who came to know and love him, how to live a life with meaning. He loved and adored his bride, Frances (Stalma) Cosgrove, throughout their 59 years of marriage; Jim was a strong, loving, and patient father to Maureen (Tom), James Jr. (Darlene), John (Kim), Frances Ann, and Kerry Ann Andrek (Adam). He is survived by 13 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. A member of the Holy Name Society of the Sacred Heart, he proudly accepted their \"Man of the Year\" honors in 2001. Relatives and friends are invited to attend the funeral from the O'Boyle Funeral Home, 309 Broad St., Bloomfield, on Friday at 9:30 a.m. The Funeral Mass will be offered at Sacred Heart Church in Bloomfield at 10:30 a.m. Interment is at Sky View Memorial Park in Tamaqua, Pa.

She passed away at Avera Sacred Heart Hospital in Yankton on August 5, 2022, at 99 years young.A celebration of her life will be held at a future date.  Arrangements are under the direction of the Wintz & Ray Funeral Home and Cremation Service in Yankton.Margie grew up on the Piersol family farm with her seven siblings and joined a large extended family of Clay County relatives. Margie attended grade school at the nearby Spirit Mound School. She graduated from the University High School on the campus of the University of South Dakota in 1941.She married that handsome US Navy pilot, Robert M. Stengle, from Yankton at the Memphis Naval Air Station on September 9, 1945. The couple moved to Vermillion where Rob attended the University under the GI Bill. Sons Robert, Jr. (1946) and Thomas (1949) were born in Vermillion. After Rob graduated from USD, the family moved to Yankton as Rob began his career with the US Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service. Son James was born in Yankton in 1951.Margie was a truly lovely person, and she made the world a little better place for many in her own quiet way. She was always willing to help and rarely needed to be asked. During World War II with the blessings of their parents, she and three of her best friends from high school moved to Kansas City and worked in the defense industry building B-25 bombers. Those \"Rosie the Riveter\" gals supported the war efforts and became unsung heroes to many. They are true icons of the women's movement.Family and faith were Margie's focus. With the move to Yankton, she joined the First United Methodist Church which was Rob's childhood church. That relationship with her Church lasted for over 70 years. When her sons were small, she helped with Sunday School.

Carol was born June 8, 1935, to Edward Thomas and Elsie Mae Klipstein at their home in Lonaconing, MD. Her parents raised Carol according to Biblical principles and imparted the values of family, hard work, perseverance, and humility.Carol loved growing up in the small coal town of \u201cConey\u201d and remained active in her church, community, and school. After graduating from Central High School in 1953, she held several jobs; however, Carol\u2019s true desire was to marry and start a family. In 1960, she married Robert P. Del Signore from New Creek, and together they raised six children and operated a dairy farm there.Carol created a humble home filled with both discipline and laughter. Carol easily made others laugh with her dry perspectives, but she could laugh at herself, too. In addition to all of the chores, she gathered the children around the piano to sing or read stories to them, as she herself was a voracious reader who visited the library regularly. Carol also loved nature. From her armchair, she watched programs about exotic wildlife. In her own yard, she enjoyed caring for the fish in the fishpond and calling to the many birds at their feeders. Carol could grow almost anything, and she was often seen in her yard or on her front porch tending to her abundant flowers.Carol also worked outside the home in various service jobs in Keyser, WV, including at the Potomac Motel and Heartland Nursing Home. In all positions, Carol became a leader because of her work ethic, integrity, and consideration for others. Never did her family hear an unkind word about their mother.Retirement in 1999 left Carol more time to spend with her growing family. She showed her grand- and great-grandchildren unconditional love and always offered encouragement and wisdom. Carol also felt blessed to have loving daughters- and sons-in-law.Devotion to her family came naturally and they adored her. Carol always put others first, and with such a modest and self-less soul, she never realized what an extraordinary person she was or how her warm - but strong - spirit would leave an indelible imprint on the hearts of all who knew her.Carol was predeceased by her husband of 53 years, Robert; her parents; an infant sister Lois, and two brothers, John E. and James Klipstein.Surviving are her children Robert Mark Del Signore (Vickie), New Creek, WV; Denise Holmes (John), Inwood, WV; Lorie Del Signore, Moorefield, WV; Anthony Del Signore (Marie), Keyser, WV; Karen Whitlock (Brent), Louisa, VA; and John Del Signore (Amy), Keyser, WV. Also missing her greatly are 14 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren; a younger brother Melvin Klipstein (Anna) of Frostburg, MD; six special nieces and nephews on her family\u2019s side; a caring, extended family on her husband\u2019s side, and many friends.Carol will be buried next to her husband at St. Thomas Cemetery, Keyser, August 16, 2022, in a private service by Smith Funeral Homes and Crematory.In lieu of flowers, please donate to New Creek Volunteer Fire Department, 3628 New Creek Highway, New Creek, WV, 26743.

He jokingly told people he had received his \"PHD\".   Kent met Karen Haug on a blind date in 1951 and they were married in Langdon, ND in 1953.  Later that year he joined the Plumbers and PipeFitters Union Local 300.  He worked as journeyman pipefitter for several years and later became a Master Plumber.  His first business, Opp & Peach, Inc., received the North Dakota Small Business of the Year Award in 1977.  In 1982, he started his own mechanical contracting business, Kent Peach, Inc. \"Peach\" was held in high regard in the construction business as he was known for doing the job right the first time.  Kent was a collector of many things, particularly cub cadets and antique tractors. He never threw anything away, preferring to store things at \"the farm\". He was an avid fisherman and hunter, flying back yearly to ND from AZ for deer season until he was 85.  Kent loved golfing every morning & evening at Lincoln Golf Course and being part of the seniors league. He treasured his friendships with his golf friends and McDonalds coffee buddies every morning in the summer months. One of Kent's hobbies was wood working and he was known for making stools with wood from Twin Birch Farm.  He made hundreds of them, gifting them to family and friends, as well as friends of friends, never asking for anything in return but a smile.   Kent lived a humble life to the absolute fullest. He was physically active from sunup to sundown, until December 20, 2016. His favorite saying was, \"Come on, we're burning daylight!\"  Kent viewed life with a \"glass half full\" attitude - he was always positive and had a dry sense of humor that made everyone laugh. Kent is survived by his loving wife Karen of 63 years; his children: Konnie (Tom) Middleton of Fountain Hills, AZ; Kim Peach (Kristy) of  Choteau, MT and Kay (Art) Culver of Grand Forks.  He is also survived by six granddaughters that thought their Grandpa Peach was bigger than life itself:  Nicole Middleton, Lindsay Middleton, Adair Peach, Ella Peach, Kourtney Culver and Kaitlan Culver.  He is also survived by his sister, Mary Ellen Cabral of Mesa, AZ. He was preceded in death by his parents, Fred and Charlotte Peach, and his brother, Jack Peach. Kent and Karen wintered in Mesa, Arizona for the past 30 years.  A memorial was held in Arizona on January 3rd at the Mesa Village clubhouse where Kent was very active and in charge of many activities.  Funeral services are planned for June 9th 2017 at Calvary Lutheran Church in Grand Forks, ND with burial in Erie, ND cemetery.  In place of flowers the family requests donations kindly to Calvary Lutheran Church or favorite charity. Arrangements under the direction of Melcher Mortuary Mission Chapel & Crematory, Mesa, AZ.",

Mahan left this world peacefully, in the arms of her daughter, the morning of Sept. 9, 2010, after 97 wonderful years.She was born July 26, 1913, to David and Delia (Kammerzell) Oakes, on a small Palouse farm near Dusty, WA. Bee lived her early years in Portland, OR, during the Great War, while her father worked the grain silos for the war effort. After WWI, Bee's family returned to the family wheat farm in Farmington, WA. It was there that fate would introduce her to her future husband, Bill. He came from Bremerton to spend a year on his Uncle's farm and would catch a ride to school with Bee on the back of her horse. He was 7, she was 10.Bee and her sister, Erville, were very close and grew up working hard together on the family farm. Bee was a good student and liked barn dances, sleigh rides, and silent movies. In high school she was awarded a ride in the first bi-wing airplane to land in Farmington & remembered the thrill of the spins and loop-de-loops. She graduated from Farmington High School in 1932 and attended Sacred Heart School of Nursing in Spokane. After graduating as a Registered Nurse in 1935, she worked at Eastern State Hospital, was married briefly and had a son, Thomas Goddard.During WWII, answering a call for nurses to care for injured servicemen, Bee moved to Bremerton with her son Tommy. She attended a local USO Social and was asked to dance by a handsome young Sergeant. During the dance Bee and Bill realized they knew each other from earlier days. Their angels congratulated each other, and Bee and Bill Mahan were married in 1946. In 1950 their daughter, Kathy, was born. Bee and Bill shared 60 loving years together before Bill's death in 2006.After the war, Bee worked at the Jackson Clinic in Bremerton. When the Doctor's Clinic was first started she continued her career as Dr. Rosendale's nurse/midwife. In 1962, Bee was offered the job of Nursing Supervisor of labor & delivery at Harrison Hospital; she retired in 1979. During her career years, she also received a Golden Acorn award for PTA work, volunteered with the Lady Elks and Lionesses and attended Olympic College evenings. Bee was a devoted mother, enjoyed sewing and gardening, cared for her elderly parents and supported Bill in countless philanthropic endeavors. But nursing was always her passion. One of the great joys of her life was assisting new mothers in the birth of their babies.After retirement, Bee & Bill enjoyed travelling, especially to Mexico. She celebrated her 80th birthday by climbing 5 major pyramids in the Yucatan. Bee attended aerobics class nearly every day at the YMCA and finished up with a mile walk. She gave up aerobics at age 90, but still enjoyed daily walks and exercising until age 96. Her body slowed down, but her spirit remained a bright and shining light.Bee lived her last 4\u00bd years with her daughter and loving caregivers at Miami Beach, Seabeck, where she and Bill had their summer home. Hospice caregivers provided an abundance of TLC in her last few months of life and son-in-law, Don, could always elicit a big smile.She is survived by her son and daughter-in-law Tom and Carol Goddard of Dayton, WA; her daughter Kathy Mahan and son-in-law Don Paulson of Seabeck, WA; sister Ervie Johnson (96) of Spokane; niece Judy (Gordon) Warren; nephew Mike (Debbie) Johnson.A celebration of Bee's life will be held at the Miller Woodlawn Chapel in Bremerton on Friday, Oct. 22nd at 1 p.m. Memorial donations may be made to Hospice of Kitsap County or to the Bremerton Food Line.",

She flew as a United Airlines flight attendant (they had to be registered nurses then) until her marriage to J. Edward Kampf in 1947. They made their home in the San Francisco Bay area where she continued her career as a registered nurse. She and her husband traveled extensively around the world after they retired, making many friends along the way.  They were married for 51 years. Edward preceded Ethel's death in July, 1998.She is the mother of two children: Deborah Essman (husband Bill) of Ellensburg and a son, Michael, of Erie, CO.  She has three grandchildren:  Sarah Kampf Jordan (Erie, CO), Ryan Kampf (Prince Frederick, MD), and Scott Essman (Ellensburg), plus one Great-Grandson, William Ridge Essman of Ellensburg.  She leaves behind many, many dear friends including her best buddy, and fellow WWII veteran, Helen Bennett. Ethel came from a large family of two brothers: Floyd and William, plus three sisters: Alice, Mary, and Judy (Dave) of Santa Clara, CA.  Judy is her only surviving sibling.After Edward's death, Ethel moved to Ellensburg in 1998 to live near her daughter and son-in-law. She quickly became involved with the community as a proud member of the American Legion and VFW.  She volunteered for the Meals on Wheels program, the Senior Center,  and at Kittitas Valley Community Hospital where she put her nursing knowledge to good use helping limited-income seniors to qualify for drug subsidies offered by pharmaceutical companies.  At the Legion and VFW, she volunteered tirelessly to support currently deployed  troops.  After volunteering for more than 4,000 hours in 10 years to a variety of county organizations, she was honored in 2010 as a Presidential Volunteer and received a personal citation from President Obama.  A graveside service will be at the High Cemetery off Robinson Canyon Road at 12 noon on Friday, June 24th. A memorial potluck and gathering of friends for Ethel will follow at 1 PM at the American Legion Hall.  All are invited to attend.Arrangements under the direction of Steward & Williams Tribute Center, Ellensburg, WA.",

        "obituary_text": "It is with tremendous sadness that the family of Charles Vincent Suphan must announce his passing. Charles passed away August 9, 2022, at Baptist Hospital in Little Rock, Arkansas. Charles leaves behind two children, Alicia Suphan, and Jesse Suphan; five grandchildren; his brother, William Suphan; his sister, Clara Wright-Sloan; and his ex-wife, Neema Suphan.He is preceded in death by his parents William Suphan (Fireman) and Ruth Suphan (Nurse); his daughter, Charlene Suphan; and his older brothers, Donald Boyer and James Boyer.Charles was born in Brooklyn, NY June 25, 1948. He grew up back and forth between Arkansas and New York. Charles had a big personality and led an even bigger life. He would often regale his kids with stories from his youth of traveling the country, the friends he met, and the trouble he got into. And there was a lot of trouble.Charles held many careers including but not limited to deep sea fisherman, carpenter, line cook, mill worker, unemployment hearing judge, and lastly attorney.Charles graduated from Berkshire Community College in Pittsfield, MA. He then went on to get his B.A. in Political Science at Amherst College, Amherst, MA class of 1986. He returned to Arkansas to study law at University of Arkansas at Little Rock School of Law and graduated in 1989. Charles passed his bar exam on the first try, which he would remind his kids frequently.Charles has been an Attorney for over 30 years in Arkansas with a long history of standing up for the little guy. One of his past paralegals quoted him as saying \u201clives are in the balance here\u201d regularly around the office. He advocated for those who needed a voice through his law practice. He represented clients pro-bono under RAINN- Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization. Before apps like \u201c23 and me\u201d or \u201cAncestry,\u201d Charles volunteered his time to help reunite families. Some of his proudest moments were reuniting parents with kids, siblings, and long-lost friends.Charles\u2019 hobbies included country music and history. Charles was major fan of Elvis Presly. On many occasions, he took his kids to Graceland to be in the presence of \u201cThe King.\u201d Charles also held a deep passion for investigating US history, especially the JFK assassination. He took his family yearly to Dallas to the grassy knoll to do his own research on the matter. He did eventually get to the bottom of it, of course.Charles\u2019 most wonderful traits were his nonjudgmental disposition, gentle demeanor, and high-spirited humor. As a person with \u201cabove average intelligence\u201d (he would want this put in), he was able to find the humor in everything. One of his most revered comedy idols was 50s comedian Lenny Bruce. Lenny Bruce once said, \u201cwithout the human condition there is no struggle, no pain, and also no laughter.\u201d Right now his family is feeling that pain and struggle. However, his family wants to thank him for his gift of laughter that helps bring them some comfort. Lenny Bruce also said, \u201cthere are never enough I love you\u2019s,\u201d and nothing is more true today. Charles always ended every phone call saying \u201cI love you\u201d because in case anything happened, those would be the last words he said to you. There are never enough opportunities to say another \u201cI love you\u201d. We love you Charles, and we will take all your lessons to heart and pass them along to those we love.Arrangements by Arkansas Cremation, 10515 W Markham St, Ste B1, Little Rock, AR 72205.Online Guestbook: www.arkansascremation.comTo send flowersto the family or plant a treein memory of Charles Vincent Suphan, please visit our floral store.",

His impressive tenure spanned for most of his life including a director with the Madison Drum and Bugle Corps Jr scouts, as a middle school basketball coach, high school basketball coach, high school softball coach, and Little League coach. He also coached 6 teams to the Badger State games and countless Sturgeon Bay city league teams. Jerry taught discipline, sportsmanship, and most of all a passion for what you do. He passed these ideals on to hundreds of players and gave his unique understanding to the next generation. He will be dearly missed, but his teachings will always survive. Rest now, your lessons have been learned and like you they will never be forgotten. Gerald is survived by his sons: Eric Lokken, and wife Jamie; Jeff Lokken, and friend Stacy Reinhart. Grandchildren: Elaina Lokken, Isabella Lesko and Terryk Lesko. Sisters: Gayle (Hank) Straw, and Glennys Kirkeeng. Along with many other nieces, nephews and cousins.The family would like to thank the friends and extended family who spent so much time visiting and supporting Jerry during his final journey.At Jerry's request there will not be a funeral service. There will be a celebration of life held at Beach Harbor Resort (3662 N. Duluth Ave. Sturgeon Bay WI 54235) October 28th from 11am-3pm.Online condolences may be offered at www.forbesfuneralhome.com",

Her extended family was large: 17 aunts and uncles between her mother and father\u2019s sides of the family, and all the cousins, too numerous to count.Sharon loved her roles as daughter, sister, aunt and great-aunt. She was an animal lover, particularly her beloved collies. She and sister Linda took great joy in the breed, raising many litters, and training them and their adoptive owners in obedience. Her last companions were Ginny, a sable, and Kenzie, a blue merle; her favorite collie was Jamie, a beautiful tri-color male, who was her devoted companion for many years. She could name every one of the collies they bred and raised, which numbered over 60.Sharon was a 25-year member of the Collie Club of America. She also achieved the equivalent of a B.S. degree with all her training in canine sciences, including genetics, behavior, grooming, obedience and confirmation. Sharon was a 1974 graduate of Lakeview High School in Battle Creek.Sharon loved to read, particularly romances and fantasy, and was an avid collector of books, including rare and first editions.Sharon was always interested in the lives of others, insisting on hearing all the details of someone\u2019s latest travel journey, their gardening successes and failures, and of course, the dog stories. She relished being able to see photos from her friends and family, especially in her later years when travel became difficult.Interment at St. Mary\u2019s Cemetery in Paw Paw will be private.

She was cared for throughout her illness by her loving husband James, with help from many family members and neighbors who were angels in their service.Cynthia was born on January 1, 1961 in Nampa Idaho. She was the tenth of eleven children born to Arlo Asay Kitchen and Fern Chase. The family moved to Utah when she was one year old. She was raised in Cache Valley in the beautiful town of Providence where she made many cherished friends and memories. She graduated from Sky View High School and Utah State University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Portrait Design.While working to establish her own business as a portrait photographer in Salt Lake, she met her eternal companion and sweetheart, James Leon Dye. They were married in the Salt Lake Temple on October 26, 1990. Cynthia designed a beautiful home for their family in South Jordan, Utah, where they lived for almost 30 years in the South Jordan Parkway 1st Ward. After five years of marriage, they were blessed to begin their adventure with adoption, eventually adopting six beautiful children.The gospel of Jesus Christ was always an important part of Cynthia\u2019s life. She served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Kobe Japan where she spent most of her time on the island of Okinawa.

She loved being with and teaching children.When Cynthia became a mother, she quit her successful photography business to focus on her children. She welcomed several additional foster children into her home, and also some young expectant mothers. As her children grew, she authored and published books, wrote poetry and songs. She ran 14 marathons and organized an annual five mile run between the Oquirrh Mountain Temple and the Jordan River Temple which raised money for the Church\u2019s Temple Patron Fund.Cynthia always loved the arts and founded a non-profit art organization, the Alliance of Covenant Artists, to promote reverential and devotional art.

        "obituary_text": "The year was 1926. Calvin Coolidge was the President of the United States, and the cost of a first-class postage stamp was all of two cents. The introduction of antifreeze had enabled people to drive their automobiles year-round.  In entertainment, RCA, GE and Westinghouse joined forces to establish NBC, which operated two national radio networks.  A new concept called \"Book of The Month Club\" was established, allowing avid readers to purchase books at a discount prices through mail order.  The St. Louis Cardinals defeated the New York Yankees to capture the World Series pennant, and a team called the Montreal Maroons were Stanley Cup Champions.  In rural Southwestern Michigan, Fred W. and his wife, Heldina (Summerfeldt) Piedt raised fruits and vegetables on their 80-acre farm near the community of Pearl Grange. Growing up, Fred W. Piedt came from North Dakota. His parents were considered to be rather wealthy, but they had somehow lost their riches in California. Eventually, the family settled in the Benton Harbor area, where soil conditions and climate were conducive to farming. Fred W. attended school only during the winter months, as his help was needed on the family farm in the spring and fall. He aided in the planting and harvesting of the family's wheat crops. Fred W. was able to complete the sixth grade before he was needed on the farm full-time. Although Heldina came to America from Volina, Russia, she was said to be as German as could be. Germans made up a majority of the residents in the Pearl Grange area. Heldina could neither read nor write, but she was a good, kind, Christian woman, a marvelous wife and mother. She loved flowers, especially gladiolas. Every fall, she insisted that her rows and rows of glad bulbs be harvested and carefully stored in the basement until the following spring, when they would once again be planted. Every week, the dear lady provided her church with a lovely, fresh floral centerpiece from her garden.Fred and Heldina were kind, generous and hard-working. Each Saturday, Heldina would butcher, dress and prepare two chickens. After church services on Sunday, they would deliver one of the chickens to Grandpa and Grandma Piedt, before going home to cook the second bird for themselves.July of 1926 was a particularly hot and humid month in much of the country.  Record temperatures of up to 108 degrees were set in Connecticut and New York.  On a steamy July 12th of that year, 38-year old Fred and his wife Heldina gave birth to little Fred.  He was a late-in-life baby for the Piedts, and his birth was eagerly anticipated by 9-year old sister Marion, the former baby of the family.  Along with Marion, Fred joined twins Florence and Lawrence (Larry), who were born in 1913; and Esther, born in 1914.  While Fred was still an infant, his parents decided that he should have a sibling that he could play and grow up with.  Ruth was born 18 months later in 1928.  Thus, the Piedt family was complete.Life in the small town of Pearl Grange was similar to many other farming communities throughout the Midwest region; the type of place where children could play the hours away in the summer sun, where neighbors all knew each other by name, and where faith, family, and hard work were all that were needed to make life complete.  Fred's family was very close-knit.  They worked hard and lived humbly.  The children learned that play involved a vivid imagination and the creek adjacent to their house, instead of fancy toys and the type of material trappings found at the local merchant.  Although they did not have much money, their lives were full of richness. One particular \"treasure\" that Fred came across was an old bike that he found in a junk yard.  He and his brother promptly set to work to try to render it road-worthy, in spite of a missing pedal.  They managed to rig it up so that it would still work, although it proved to not be as reliable as they had hoped.  One day, as he was riding the new-found bike down a hill, a mechanical failure of some sort occurred caused the front wheel to come off the bike driving the forks into the ground, and Fred went tumbling over the handlebars, landing in a heap near the bike.  Although slightly injured, Fred's childhood temper overcame him, and he arose, picked up the bike, and mustering all of his strength, threw it in the creek.  Later, after his cuts and scratches healed and his anger over the failed two-wheeler had subsided, he returned to the creek to retrieve the bike.Little Fred never knew the concept of being left with a babysitter.  He was always with his mother, or one of his older sisters if his mom was working in the fields.  He became particularly close to Marion, who was most often the sibling that took care of him when needed.  In his early years, he came to think of Marion as his mother.  When it was time for play, however, he often turned to younger sister Ruth for companionship.  He came to depend on Ruth to help him with his extreme bashfulness, even delaying the start of school for a year and a half until Ruth was ready to begin, just to avoid having to go to school alone.When Fred was a young lad of about ten years, a tragedy struck the family on Christmas Day.  The family home had caught on fire, and promptly burned to the ground.  Everyone was able to emerge from the home safely, but all of their material possessions were a total loss.  The only Christmas present that was able to survive was the family's new puppy, a present from their parents.  Thankful for their safety, and reminded that the true meaning of Christmas was not about presents and material belongings, the family gathered themselves together and thanked God for what they did have... each other.  The family went to live with various relatives in the area until their home was able to be rebuilt.Because his shy demeanor had delayed his start of school, Fred was grateful to a caring elementary teacher named Mrs. Burr who helped him catch up two grades in one year.  He made the 1-1/2 mile trek to Pearl Grange Elementary school every day, in all types of weather.  As a young man, school and life on the farm didn't allow Fred much free time. He was able, however, to manage some extracurricular activities during his career at Benton Harbor High School.  Not the best of students, Fred's report cards often reflected D's.  He particularly struggled in History and English, and failing tests in those subjects became a common occurrence.  The one subject where he did excel was German, since it was spoken fluently by his parents at home.  He also enjoyed typing, although he was only one of two boys in a class of 32 girls.  Popular with his female classmates, he reveled in the extra attention he received as being one of a minority.  The girls often flocked around him in order to help him with his homework.  Perhaps it was then that this painfully bashful young man blossomed; he was later described in his high school yearbook as being \"a ladies' man\".  The new, confident Fred went on to join the Camera Club, the Rifle Club, and the Future Farmers of America.  His athletic talents honed by years of working on the farm and rugged play, he was able to join the track team.  He often bragged about his star achievement: running the 100-yard dash in ten seconds flat.The start of his senior year was delayed until November, because he had to help with that fall's apple harvest.  World War II had taken most of the able-bodied men off to war, often leaving women and children to do their work at home. After his dear mother, Heldina passed away from an enlarged heart in 1941, Fred's obligation to the family was intensified, and he stepped up to the task by helping out on the farm.  In spite of this delay, along with his academic struggles, much to his relief and delight, he accepted his diploma from Benton Harbor High School in 1944.   Tragedy once again struck the family on July 1, 1944, when Fred's father was involved in a head-on collision, breaking every rib, and puncturing his lungs in two places.  Fred briefly attended Michigan State University in 1945, but once again felt the calling of family, and returned home to tend to the family farm and nurse his dad back to health.  The senior Fred's recovery went remarkably well under his son's care.  Once he was assured that his father was on his way to good health, the young man went to the draft board on a fateful day in October 1945 and was put on 1-A.  On October 18, 1945, he received a letter from Franklin D. Roosevelt, welcoming him to the Armed Services.  He was proud to be a World War II Veteran, serving in the Pacific Theater of Operations, ending up in the Tachikawa Army Air Force Base near Tokyo, Japan in 1946.  He served his country until his honorable discharge in January 1947.  Once back in the United States, a chance meeting at his cousin Ruth Prillwitz' wedding in June 1949 caused him to cross paths with a young woman named Dorothy Michael.  The two were both in the wedding party; Fred was an usher, and \"Dot\", as her friends lovingly called her, was the Maid of Honor.  Although he was smitten with her immediately, Dot barely noticed him.  During the reception, however, she was forced to take notice: Fred repeatedly flung wads of paper at her until she paid attention to him.  Shortly after their first meeting, the pair picked berries together on her parents' farm, which provided them the ability to spend much more time together.  On a fishing trip that August with his sister Marion and her husband, Fred mustered up his strength and anxiously asked Dorothy, \"If I were to give you a ring, would you take it?\"  Dorothy replied, \"Sure\".  Achieving the desired response, the resourceful young man was prepared.  He immediately slammed on the brakes, pulled to the side of the road, and opened the trunk to retrieve the engagement ring he had stashed there.  Not wanting to wait much longer to become man and wife, the young couple were joined in marriage on October 1, 1949 at the Clay Street Baptist Church, which was later renamed Napier Parkview Baptist Church.Fred continued to enjoy fishing long after that engagement afternoon in 1949.  The Piedts owned a camper, which they left at the Sandy Pines Campground in Burnips, Michigan.  This became their summer getaway, and they enjoyed meeting with many of their lifelong friends at this lovely spot.  It was a place where many happy family memories were made.  The bass fishing made the spot especially alluring for Fred.  This oasis was often the goal destination in the summer; they would work extra hard on the farm all week, just to be rewarded with the ability to sneak away to Sandy Pines on the weekend.  Never one to completely abandon his work responsibilities, Fred would call back home to the spray consultant to check on weather conditions.  If needed, he sometimes would have to reluctantly return home to spray.  As much as Sandy Pines was their summer getaway, he and Dot found winter solace in Florida.  Fred was especially proud of his coveted \"ultimate fishing boat\", and spent many a winter day in the Florida sun, casting his line upon the water.  While in Florida, they usually would rent a house for the winter months, and enjoyed inviting Mike, his wife Deb, and the grandchildren down for a visit. Perhaps because of his experience in the Army Air Force, aviation was in Fred's blood.  Although he was never able to fly during his tour in World War II, he always had a passion for it.  In 1960, he took it up as a long-desired hobby in the hopes of being able to crop dust his own farm.  After taking lessons in Benton Harbor, he was devastated to learn that the J-3 Cub in which he had learned to fly had been destroyed in a hangar fire.  He thought that his flying days were over.  Fortunately, he was mistaken.  He went to Dowagiac, where he met Grady O'Diton, a fellow that had a 1946 7-AC Aeronca for sale.  Fred was delighted to find that Grady would sell him the plane for $1,000, and even more so when Grady took over as his new flying instructor.  It was July, 1960, and the start of a new passion that lasted for the rest of Fred's life.  It took him a while to get his student pilot's license because he would spend so much of his time looking instead of learning.Not to be outdone by her newly-adventurous husband, Dorothy obtained her student pilot's license.  A larger plane was now in order, and later in 1960, Fred obtained a five-year-old Cessna 170-B, for which he paid $5,000.  Fueled by the desire to pilot his new aircraft, Fred studied in earnest, and was able to pass the written test and receive his FAA Private Pilot's License in August, 1961. New pilots Fred and Dorothy enjoyed taking many short trips to Grand Rapids, Fort Wayne, and Chicago's Meigs Field.  Their most adventurous flight was a trip to see Dot's parents in St. Petersburg, Florida.  The flight took a total of ten hours.  On the way home, after encountering bad weather, the couple took an unexpected stopover in Atlanta, which ended up lasting for several days.Another interesting experience, about which the two look back and laugh, occurred when Dorothy dropped Fred off at the hangar to take the plane up for a short flight.  After getting up in the air, Fred realized that he had the keys to the house in his pocket so Dorothy wouldn't be able to get in!  With no way of communicating with her, Fred proceeded to locate his wife on the road and followed her home.  After arriving home, Dorothy discovered their mistake and noticed Fred circling the house in the plane.  Fred used some of his considerable ingenuity and, after several passes, was able to get the plane low enough \u2013 without stalling the plane \u2013 to pass over their garage, drop the keys onto its metal roof, and watch as the keys slid off the roof to his stranded wife.Theirs was a joyful marriage, and Fred and Dorothy relished being with each other and serving the Lord together as husband and wife.  After 14-1/2 years, they were blessed with a son that they named Michael David, brought into this world on April 4, 1964.  He was the joy of their lives, and they loved being parents, teaching young Michael the value of hard work, vigorous play, and reverent worship.  He was showered with an abundance of love.  While young Michael had flown in five different planes before even reaching his first birthday, Dorothy felt it more important to spend time with her new son with feet planted firmly on the ground.  Realizing that flight without his wife and son in the plane would be less enjoyable, Fred resigned himself to the fact that his flying days may be over.  He sold the Cessna 170-B, resorting to renting a plane for future flights.  It seemed to be a minor sacrifice when he considered the blessings that Michael had brought into their lives.In addition to being an accomplished pilot, Fred was a great bookkeeper and a clever inventor.  He was very meticulous about his accounting practices, working sometimes for hours to assure that every penny was accounted for.  He patiently taught Deb, his beloved daughter-in-law, to take over the books.  He had a knack for miraculously fixing machinery that seemed beyond repair, or conjuring up ingenious ways to operate the farm more efficiently.  One of his crowning achievements was the tractor cab that he fashioned out of Plexiglass.Mike was the envy of all of his classmates because of one of his father's crafty inventions.  He fashioned a \"Batman Pole\" that allowed young Mike and his friends to slide from his bedroom closet, clear down to the basement toy room.  His friends thought he just might have the coolest dad on the planet earth!Still involved in aviation, Fred served on the aviation committee of the Grand Rapids School of the Bible and Music (GRSBM).  The school wanted to update their fleet of aircraft, so Fred acquired a 1946 Taylor Craft from them for $1,500, and his dream of aircraft ownership was revived.  Fred would use the plane in the summer months to teach Michael and would return the plane back to the school during the school year to teach the new students how to fly.  As the plane didn't have a starter, Fred had Michael prop the plane to start it.  Because this particular aircraft could land in short distance, he built his own runways and hangar.  He would park the plane in the hangar, and in an effort to also be practical, would store his farm implements and tools under its wings.In February 1979, he donated the aircraft back to the school and bought a Cessna 140.  In order to be able to fly it in the winter as well, he installed some skis on the plane.  Young Mike was now 15 years old, and was sometimes called upon to use his youthful brawn to push the plane when it would get stuck in the deep snow.  Once it was underway, he would run alongside the plane and jump in just prior to takeoff, face flushed and heart pounding.  Their adventures with this aircraft culminated in an incident where the plane had run out of gas during takeoff, causing Fred and Mike to crash land in the rye field on the Carl farm.  The father and son had evidence of their Father's eternal protective hand on that day.In June, 1979, he bought an F-19 Taylor Craft after selling the Cessna 140.  When Mike turned 16 the following year, while most of his classmates were receiving their driver's licenses, Mike received his student pilot's license first, obtaining this accomplishment on April 4, 1980.  Mike took advantage of this new-found freedom and dive-bombed his best friend's home during his graduation open house, startling all of his guests!When Mike and Deb's children were small, Poppy Fred bolted child-sized seats in the tractor cabs so they would be able to accompany him when he was spraying or plowing.  As often the case with children and moving vehicles, however, the movement of the tractor would cause the children to drift off, and their little heads would bang against the window.  This became the favorite way to lull restless children off to sleep, although this practice could not be employed regularly, lest the children's little heads become permanently bruised.  He loved his grandchildren, and enjoyed teaching little Ryan how to become a future mechanic.True to being a stickler with the finances, Fred was also determined to teach the youngsters fiscal responsibility.  He was a good role model, and practiced what he preached.  He taught the value of hard work and to be a cheerful giver, admonishing Mike and the grandchildren to give generously, since \"you can't outgive the Lord\".  He had also learned that it is best to live beneath your means, save for a rainy day, and not to put all of your eggs in one basket; sage wisdom from a humble man.  One of Mike's favorites that he heard often from his father was:  \"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\".A tribute to Fred's life cannot be complete without mention of his greatest joy in life: accepting the Lord Jesus as his own personal Savior.  He was honored that he was given a wife that also loved and served the Lord.  He had the distinct pleasure of traveling to Israel in 1974 and 1976.  He found great peace and joy in the fact that his children and grandchildren also grew to walk with The Lord.  Some of his favorite verses were II Corinthians 8:9, Psalm 16:16, II Timothy 1:12, Ephesians Chapter 1, and John 20:29.  While Fred was returning from Tokyo at the end of World War II on their vessel \"The Marshall Victory\", the ship encountered storms and 70-foot swells that lasted more than a week.  The crew worked feverishly to weld the ship day and night to keep it afloat.  When they thought the boat would sink, Fred sought comfort in recalling scripture and singing some of his favorite hymns, such as \"A Wonderful Savior in Jesus My Lord\", \"A Shelter in the Time of Storm\", and \"He is So Precious to Me\".  Fortunately, Fred had dozens more favorite hymns that helped him to know that the Lord was with him.His dear wife of 57 years remembers that Fred was always faithful to his word.  He counted his daughter-in-law, Deb, as \"his child\" along with her husband Mike, and he loved them dearly.  He would brag about his \"kids\" to everyone and anyone who would listen.  He was ever interested in Mike's activities and was eager to offer his advice and mechanical expertise on the farm.  He loved to recall the \"good old days\" when he spent time with Mike, passing along stories that will be repeated for generations to come.  He is remembered by all as a loving, helpful man that thought of others first and himself last.  He enjoyed fixing things and using his inventions to improve the quality of life.  He was a loving example not only in his life, but in his passing as well.  When he was first diagnosed with cancer, he was the one that consoled his family, taking comfort in knowing that he was one day closer to being forever united with his Lord and Savior.  He quoted II Timothy 1:12 to them, saying: \"I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day\". His family now takes comfort in knowing that one day, they, too, will be united with Dad in the Master's presence.  He did not fear death, for he knew that to be absent from the body was to be present with the Lord, and he was at peace, although parting with his loved ones here on earth was a sweet sorrow.Fred led an active and full life, serving not only the Lord, but his community as well.  He served on several boards, including Berrien Center Bible Church, Grace Christian School, American Messianic Fellowship in Chicago.  He also served on the Aviation committee of Grand Rapids School of the Bible and Music, the Berrien County Youth for Christ, the Eau Claire Fruit Exchange, and the Michigan Flying Farmers.Fred J. Piedt left this earth to be with his Father on March 13, 2007, at the age of 80, after a courageous battle with esophageal cancer.  Services celebrating his life will be held on Friday, March 16, 2007 at 11:00 am, at the Berrien Center Bible Church.  Burial will follow at Caldwell Cemetery, Eau Claire, which adjoins the Piedt Farms apple orchard. Those wishing to sign the guest book or share an encouraging thought with the family may do so at www.legacyfuneral.com.  Friends are invited to visit with the family from 5-8 pm on Thursday, March 15, 2007 at the Legacy Funeral Services \u2013 Matthew R. Purchase Chapel, Berrien Springs.  Fred leaves behind his loving wife, Dorothy (Michael) Piedt, his precious son, Michael (Deborah) Piedt, and three grandchildren, Ryan, Mandy and Gregory Piedt of Eau Claire, Michigan.  They will miss their Poppy Fred very much.  He is also survived by sister Ruth (Fred) Holden of Baroda, and Marion Taylor of Saginaw, Michigan.  He was preceded in death by his parents; brother Larry F. Piedt, and sisters Florence Johansen and Esther Hards.  Memorial contributions may be made to Berrien Center Bible Church or to Hospice at Home from Kalamazoo.  What was most important to Fred was that those he came in contact with came to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.  He will be greatly missed by his friends and family until they meet again.",

        "obituary_text": "John Clarence Medema (84) of Holland, Michigan returned to his heavenly home on January 3, 2017.  Beloved husband of 62 years, he is survived by his only sibling, Gertrude Kloese, his loving wife, Dolores A. Medema (Natelborg) and their five children: Diane (George) Huisman; Janet (Ed) Kotynski; Paul (Betty) Medema; Daniel Medema and Connie Huizenga. John was blessed to be Grandpa to Wendi (John) Kitsteiner  and Keith (Adrienne) Huisman; Cara (Brian) Hurley  and Eddie (Hannah) Kotynski; Hope (Tom) Acker; Dolores Medema; Casey Huizenga and Colin Huizenga.  He was preceded in death by granddaughter, Faye Medema.  John was a fond Uncle, and happy and proud great-grandpa, as well.He lived his life devoted to his family and his faith in Jesus Christ. As his earthly body was failing him and he prepared to say good bye, he expressed both his wish to remain to experience the growing up of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, (including the expected birth of another great-grandchild near his birthday), and his longing to meet Jesus and feel his touch.John was born to the late Cornelius Medema (Chicago, Illinois) and Margaret Plantenga (Lafayette, Indiana) on March 26, 1932. After graduating from high school, he served in the U.S. Army from 1952-1954 as a Corporal in the Korean Conflict.  He was honorably discharged on April 30, 1954, and married Dolores just a few days later on May 7, 1954.John was employed at Jewel Foods from 1950-1970, twelve of those years as store manager. He then learned the tile business in order to switch careers to something that would allow him more time with his wife and family.John was known for being a man who loved life, people, and Oreo cookies! He deeply enjoyed his family, friends and his daily relationship with God. Spending time with those he loved, traveling with friends and family (especially his wife), and sports were some of his favorite pastimes. He was a larger than life presence, and will be sorely missed by those who loved him.John said of his accomplishments, that he felt happy he could help many people in many different ways and that his life showed that God does care about us and will help us in times of trouble. The final message he wrote to family and friends was this:\"Make God an important part of your life. Enjoy Life. Have Fun. Don't be afraid to laugh at yourself. Remember as you serve others, you serve God. Love people \u2013 not everyone is loveable, but everyone needs love.\"He loved his church and was always involved, whether it was teaching Sunday School, working with the youth, or serving as a deacon or elder. Even in his 80's John served as an usher, was involved in the prayer partner ministry, the food pantry, and benevolent and mission committees. It was important to John that his children knew that his involvement with church and serving others did not guarantee him a place in a heaven. These activities helped him express his gratitude for Christ's sacrifice on the cross for his salvation. And he wanted all of his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren to share his faith in Christ's death, burial and resurrection and to know Him in a personal relationship.A military burial (family only) will take place on May 5, 2017 at Fort Custer National Cemetery in Battlecreek, MI, 2:30 pm. (Please meet there 15 minutes early at the gate).  On Saturday, May 6, 2017 a Memorial service and celebration of his life will be held  at Thorn Creek Reformed Church in South Holland, Illinois.  The service begins at 11 am, followed by a luncheon in the fellowship hall.  A small service was be held with John and Dolores' church family and local friends on Saturday January 21 at 2:30 pm at Bethany Christian Reformed Church in Holland MI. It is the family's hope that many who loved him will be able to come together at that time in celebration of John's life and the blessing he was to us all.The family asks tha tIn lieu of flowers, please send Cards &/or donations towards his Rest Haven bill and memorial: to Dolores Medema, The Village Appledorn, #224, Holland MI",

Many electrical contractors in Jacksonville obtained their first credit for their young businesses from Lew. Lew was heavily involved in the Jacksonville Jewish community, being a past president of Jewish Family and Community Services, a vice president of the Jacksonville Jewish Center, and his passion, River Garden Hebrew Home, where he served as president of the home and of the Coves, the independent living facility on the campus. No significant event happened in River Garden for almost 50 years without Lew's intimate involvement. After all the years Lew served River Garden, River Garden served Lew beautifully in his last years. Lew was an extremely devoted family man, and is survived by his wife of almost 37 years, Evelyn, 4 children, Steven, Rachel, Beth (Ed) Glad and Bill (Lynn Collins) as well as a stepson, Charlie (Lisa) Hazouri. He had 6 grandchildren, Deborah, Michael, Jennifer, Kirsten, Sydney and Olivia, as well as a step granddaughter, Christina Hazouri.

She also created and marketed a Branson themed Trivia Game as well as a set of humorous post cards reflecting tourist life in Branson.Ms V, as she was affectionately known in Olla, LA, had a deep abiding relationship with her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and despite her love of Branson, she felt the Lord asking her to move back to Olla in order to help look after her brother Clinton, who was in declining health. This she did for several years until his passing.Virginia worked for several years at the Centennial Cultural Center in Olla. She loved her job - working with the kids at summer camp, interviewing and writing stories of local legends in the area; she enjoyed chatting it up with out-of-town tourists who visited the Cultural Center and she wrote a humorous column in the local paper. After her job ended, she continued to volunteer at the Center.Afterwards, Virginia began attending Zion Hill Baptist Church which she loved dearly and where she made close friends. When her health took a turn and she realized she could no longer be on her own, she lived her remaining time in a nursing home in Natchez, MS.

She was the daughter of T. Dale and Gertrude Thomas of Centralia, IL. Dee graduated from Centralia Township High School before graduating from Lindenwood University with a degree in Home Economics.In a time where not many women were graduating from college and joining the workforce, Dee excelled in her studies and became an educator. She spent her career teaching students in Home Economics, Gifted Programs, and Special Education. She was an active member of the Philanthropic Educational Organization (PEO) Sisterhood, receiving recognition in 2016 for 50 years of membership. She served as chapter president on two occasions. Her husband was active in the Shrine and she served as the Potentate\u2019s wife, which was a 10 year commitment. Through her work as a teacher, her volunteer contributions, and numerous cross country moves, Dee was able to positively impact many lives.Dee began sewing at the age of 10 and continued until her final years, making jackets that doubled as art pieces, quilts, and dozens of baby blankets that she gifted to family and friends. She was also an avid reader, a lover of classical and country music, and in her retirement years, a chardonnay enthusiast. If it was 3pm in the afternoon, you\u2019d see Dee with a glass of white in her hand and the Hallmark channel on tv.Dee was fortunate enough to meet the love of her life, Jimmie \u201cJim\u201d Neil Griner, in high school and spent 65 years by his side. Their love was deeply rooted in friendship and their simple, yet thoughtful acts like a newspaper section and coffee placed out in the morning served as a reminder that no matter how long you\u2019re together, you need to put the effort in. Jim preceded Dee in death in 2016 after a long battle with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. The pair were inseparable in life and could not be separated by death itself, choosing the words, \u201cpartners in life and beyond\u201d for their final resting place together.She is survived by her brother, Don, with whom she maintained a close relationship right up until her final days and her daughters Carolyn Hoyer and Vicki Matijevich, both strong women whom she was deeply proud of. One of her favorite titles during her life was \u2018grandma.\u2019 She was actively involved in the lives of her 4 grandchildren as they grew up by providing guidance on homework, sewing lessons, and root beer floats upon request. She is also survived by 5 great grandchildren and 3 granddogs (we don\u2019t know if you count those, but Dee would have). Her legacy is carried on by the family that loves her.To leave a condolence or share a memory of Dee visit the Tribute Wall.To plant a beautiful memorial tree in memory of Dolores, please visit our Tree Store or plant a tree.",

Wayne loved salt and pepper and he put both on everything he ate to \u201cgive food some taste\u201d along with cheeseburgers that we referred to as hockey pucks because they were burnt to a crisp. Although he would joke about hating old people, small children and dogs; anyone that had the honor of calling him a friend knows that those are the 3 groups that flocked to him without hesitation to bask in his unwavering kindness.This mountain of a man lived a life that would give any Hollywood movie script a run for its money. From breaking both arms at the same time in a Waggener High School football game and proudly serving his country in the Vietnam War, to singing in a band that opened for the Rolling Stones and racing motorcycles and cars (well past his prime), Wayne lived life to the fullest. He also opened his own small business in Middletown, announced all of the Eastern High School football and basketball games for 20 years and was an active member of the Wilderness Rangers.But the greatest love of his life (and no, not his 47 Oldsmobile) was his wife of 52 years. Wayne and Debbie demonstrated what it meant to love unconditionally without fear. All the laughter and joy shared together throughout the years were the rewards for their incredible devotion to their marriage.Surrounded by family, friends and loyal dogs, Wayne is survived by his wife Debbie, his son Eric (Tonya), his daughter Courtney (Jamie), four grandchildren that were the center of his world, JD, Grayson, Eleanora and Maggie and his brother John (Wanda). His celebration of life will take place Saturday, August 27 at Ratterman\u2019s Funeral Home in Middletown, Kentucky. The visitation will be held from noon to 3:00 immediately followed by the service at 3:00. In lue of flowers, the family ask that you make donations in his name to the Shamrock Pet Foundation, Inc.",

        "obituary_text": "Doris Schaefer died peacefully on March 25, 2021 at the age of 91. Her family and friends in the United States and Switzerland will deeply miss her vivacious, generous spirit.    Doris was born on May 25, 1929 in Heiden, Switzerland. Because her father, Ernst Marti, was a Methodist minister, her family had an itinerant lifestyle, moving every few years to serve congregations in various towns in the German speaking part of the country. Her mother Rosalie was a devoted pastor's wife, helping her husband in his ministerial work, cooking meals at large extended family gatherings, while also finding time to play the harmonium in church. Doris was soon joined in the Marti family by sisters and brothers: Mich, Dan, Ruth, and Theo.   As the eldest child, Doris took wonderful care of her younger siblings \u2013 teaching, admonishing, and loving them. Her sister recalls how Doris managed her father's rabbit hutch in the garden, feeding and talking to the rabbits while carefully protecting the vegetables and flowers with netting. During the resource-scarce war years Doris was heartbroken when her charges began to go missing, only to wind up on the dinner table \u2013 she refused, of course, to eat the rabbit stew.   Doris always loved music and was an accomplished young recorder player. She performed in her school orchestra, several times as a soloist, and the whole Marti family would proudly attend her concerts.   During Doris' childhood years, young people living in German speaking Switzerland were obliged to spend a year in the French speaking cantons in order to learn the language. Doris went to Lausanne where she worked as an au pair. The experience gave her the opportunity to travel abroad as a teenager \u2013 working as an au pair, baby nurse, or house sitter and other jobs in London, New York, Miami, and Chicago. She was always much appreciated and loved by the families she stayed with.   When she returned to Switzerland after her overseas adventures, she worked as an elegant receptionist and secretary for Graphis, a graphic design magazine, at its Zurich headquarters. While working at the prestigious publication she met and befriended many artists and writers.  While in Zurich, Doris also met a young American doctor visiting Switzerland from his station at a US Air Force base in Turkey. Robert Schaefer had in fact made the long trip with a secret purpose in mind: to marry the lovely and eligible Doris. He was acting on a tip he received from an Air Force colleague, Ron \u2013 who had recently married Doris' sister Ruth. Bob's attempts to woo Doris were not always on the mark. For example, Bob had acquired a pair of traditional Austrian lederhosen, which while fashionable in some German speaking regions of the Alps were not in vogue at the time in Zurich. Doris, the urbane young woman from an international design magazine, was unmoved by his sartorial display. But Bob was persistent, staying with the Marti family for weeks during his frequent visits to Switzerland, making their home his headquarters for explorations of Europe. Eventually, Doris was charmed by the intrepid Alpine hiker and the two were married in Winterthur in February 1962. Their honeymoon travels included a visit to her sister and Ron in the Middle East.  Doris and Bob moved to Palo Alto for a few years, to complete Bob's medical residency at Stanford, before finally settling in Seattle. Doris enthusiastically immersed herself in Seattle life, finding many ways to engage with the community.  She was active in Plymouth Church where for years she provided the flowers in the sanctuary every Sunday.  She was a dedicated volunteer at Mary's Place, the only women's shelter active in Seattle at that time. Doris loved socializing and would frequently get together with French speaking friends and expatriates to happily converse in the language. Over the years she also fostered, and sometimes adopted, many needy cats from the Seattle Animal Shelter. Doris and Bob were both for many years devoted fans and dedicated supporters of Seattle Opera. Doris loved to contribute as a volunteer driver for visiting musicians and frequently hosted opera luminaries at her house.   Although Doris became a naturalized US citizen and adapted to her new country's culture during her sixty years here, the Swiss girl from Winterthur was always there. She never failed to honor her homeland's National Day on August 1st with a party for Swiss expats on the balcony of her Magnolia home. The setting was decorated festively with lampions and candles, and a giant Swiss flag, visible even to passing ships in Puget Sound, hung from the railing. She kept up old traditions like lighting her Christmas tree with real candles, although one year the tree ignited, leaving a scorched ceiling and an indelible memory for her young niece and nephew from Tacoma. Her Br\u00e4tzeli \u2013 thin, intricately decorated Swiss cookies, made on a special imported waffle iron \u2013 were coveted by all who knew her. When Doris' family and friends from Switzerland came to visit, their suitcases would always be stuffed full of the thing they knew she craved - bars of Shoggi, genuine Swiss chocolate. And in another touching connection late in her life, Doris' brother-in-law Erich called her every week from the town of her childhood, holding up the phone so she could hear the familiar peals of the church bells of Zofingen. Her crisp Swiss accent never lost its lilt during her six decades in America.  Doris and Bob were intrepid travelers, making trips to far flung destinations like China and Antarctica when those places were still far off the beaten path.  Most of all, Doris will be remembered by her loved ones for her warmth and charm. She was full of energy (in spite of the Seattle gloom, when she preferred sunshine) and seemed to be in action nonstop. She loved visits from family: although she had no children of her own, she cared for her nephews and nieces, both in the US and Switzerland, with infinite kindness and patience. Indeed, throughout her life Doris was a family linchpin: she loved throwing magnificent Thanksgiving and Christmas parties at her house and hosted a steady stream of visitors from Switzerland and all parts of the world. Doris was elegant but down to earth, funny and honest. She touched many people during her life and her passing leaves a large empty space but also wonderful memories.   In her final years Doris' health suffered with the effects of stroke and dementia. But she was cared for lovingly by Bob. He took over the cooking, played music for Doris and read to her, often poetry. They were separated when Bob succumbed to Covid on March 25, 2020, and it seems fitting that Doris passed away on the same day as her companion of 58 years, one year later.    Doris will be remembered fondly by her brothers, Dan and Theo, her sister Ruth, and by her extended family, including the Becks in Seattle and Denver, the Martis and Scholls in Switzerland and the Schaefers and Abrams in Boston and Raleigh.",

His brothers Barry and Kevin were with him at the time of his death. Born on September 15, 1946 in Queens, New York, John, along with his 3 brothers, were moved by their parents John Sr. and Margaret Erb to Guilford in 1954. He went through the Guilford school system, where he was a very good student and athlete. John once scored 42 points in a junior high basketball game. He graduated from Guilford High School in 1965, where he played varsity basketball, baseball and soccer, being captain of the soccer team his senior year. Somehow, in his senior year, he found the time to join the Band and became an all-state drummer. John went on to attend New York University, where he graduated in 1969 with a degree in marketing. John had a love for music, especially jazz and the sea, once owning and living on a sailboat. His love for jazz came from his Dad and his uncle Fred Erb. Like his uncle, John would play the drums professionally for many years. John remembered some great childhood friends, Kenny DeMond, Dan Dolan, John Gibson, Bob Harding and Andy Crampton, just to mention a few. John was predeceased by his parents, his wife Terri, and his loving brother Dennis. He leaves his brothers Barry and Kevin, a nephew Ryan, and nieces Kerry, Taryn, Emily, Elizabeth and Erin. Also left are two special people in his life, Mark Petruzzello and Evelyn Coogan. John\u2019s wish was that his remains be donated for research to the Anatomical Gift Program at Quinnipiac University. His wish was granted. Thank you Jim Casso for making that happen. A special thanks to the nurses and staff at Connecticut Hospice in Branford for their tender and loving care for John in his final days. In a handwritten note given to his brother Barry a week before his death, John wrote \u201cThe remaining days of my life are in the hands of some special people in a very special place\u201d So true.

Born February 25, 1938, in Baltimore, MD, he was a son of the late Ernest and Louise (Lewis) Grubb. He enlisted in the US Army in 1965 and accepted an appointment in the Regular Army in 1966. Richard served two tours of duty in Vietnam, was stationed in Germany as well as stateside, and attained the rank of Captain; he retired from the US Army Reserve having earned the rank of Major. He accepted a position with the U.S. Government Supply Service Center in Perry Point, MD following his active military service. Prior to his retirement in 2003, he was responsible for directing shipments of medical supplies throughout the world.  Richard served on the Board of Trustees, and was a Gold Legacy Member, of the Shellsville VFW Post 9639. He was also a Life Member of the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) Capital Chapter #542 and the American Legion Jeff Davis Post #18 in Centreville, MD. A kind and thoughtful man, he possessed the unique ability to talk to anyone at any time. While he was known to be helpful to a fault, and inclined to step in to assist with any need, Richard always placed his primary focus on his family. He enjoyed gardening and cooking; and, never heard a joke - good or bad - he didn't appreciate and share. Throughout the past two years, even with increasing health concerns, he never lost his sense of humor. The next time you see a formation of geese flying overhead, think of him and smile.  In addition to his wife of 30 years, Patricia A. (Oberlin) Grubb, he is survived by four daughters, Carole Eisenstein of Mechanicsburg, Denise Ackley of Harrisburg, Jill (Jim) Walls of Virginia Beach, VA and Jodi (Bill) Schnoor of Middletown.

Previously, he worked at the Centro At\u00f3mico in Bariloche, Argentina, where he also earned his PHD.

        "obituary_text": " NELSON, Irving T. - Of Davison, died December 15, 2010, age 79. Irving was born March 17, 1931, to Donald and Margaret Nelson, in Iron Mountain Michigan. He loved Michigan's Upper Peninsula and returned frequently throughout his life. Irving excelled academically, winning the state-wide competition for the Detroit Free Press Forensic Scholarship as a high school student. He was graduated with honors from Michigan State University (1951) and from Harvard Law School (1954). He served his country in the United States Army after law school. He then returned to Michigan to establish his law practice. On June 28, 1958, Irving married Sarah Jane Gwyn, of Flint. Together, they raised four children: Margaret, Jane, Thomas, and Patrick. He was a loving and generous husband and father. Irving possessed a formidable intellect. He read voraciously and was a knowledgeable and perceptive conversationalist in a wide variety of subjects. His interests included history, science, current affairs, sports, hunting and the stock market. He understood and appreciated good music, art, books, wine and food, especially chocolate. In addition to his scholarly pursuits, he was an avid hunter and fisherman; he shared his love for the outdoors with his children whenever possible. Irving was a skilled lawyer and an avid student of the law. He practiced law for over 50 years, primarily in Genesee County. His areas of practice included business law and securities regulation, personal injury, and general civil litigation. His clients benefitted not only from his legal knowledge and skills, but from his sense of humor and deep understanding of human nature. He represented his clients vigorously, but he would readily forgo a short term tactical advantage in the long term best interest of his client. He treated everyone involved in the legal process with courtesy and respect. Irving was a generous and loyal colleague, mentor and friend to many lawyers, judges, and others in the legal community. Irving was an ardent believer in the cause of social justice, belonging to many service organizations including the League of Women Voters, the Welfare Board of Flint and the Valley Area Agency on Aging. During his service on the Welfare Board, he was responsible for expanding the breadth of services to underserved populations, and in increasing the funding to those services from stage agencies. Among others, he was a generous supporter of the Southern Poverty Law Center, Habitat for Humanity and the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan. His survived by his wife, Sarah Jane Nelson, of Davison, his four children, Margaret L. Nelson of Chicago, Jane Marie Nelson of Lansing, Dr. Thomas Edward Nelson and wife Dr. Michele Acker of Columbus, OH and their two sons, Avery Thomas and Oliver Channing, and Patrick Allen Nelson and his wife Mellissa Hasler, MSW, of Flint. He is also survived by siblings Alice Brown of Wauwatosa, WI, Dr. Merlin A. Nelson of Iron Mountain, Donald Nelson of Bloomfield Hills, Carol Krautner, of Hartland Wisconsin, Mavis Powell, of Midland, MI, Norma Scolatti, of Des Moines, IA, The Honorable Allen J. Nelson, of Harbor Springs, and Patricia Nolf of Lake Orion, MI and many loving in-laws, nephews and nieces. He was preceded in death by his parents and by his sister, Katherine Gulash. The family will receive visitors between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. on Sunday, December 19, at Hansen Funeral Home in Davison. The memorial service will be Monday, December 20, at Noon, at the funeral home. Those who wish to honor Irving's memory may make a memorial contribution to WKAR radio, of Michigan State University, in East Lansing, MI, or the Donald and Margaret Nelson Scholarship Fund, in Iron Mountain, MI, in memory and honor of his parents.",

        "obituary_text": "ZELLA PRETZER  Zella passed away on Friday, February 25, 2005, due to complications from a stroke she suffered in 2001. Although the last three years were difficult, her remarkable strength, positive attitude and love of family remained constant. During that time she found comfort and new friends at the California Armenian Home, where she was also able to spend time with Arthur, her loving husband of 57 years, prior to his passing in September 2003. Zella was born on April 27, 1917, to Joseph and Mary De Luca, the youngest of three brothers and three sisters. She was raised in West Fresno's Old Italian Town and graduated from Edison Technical High School. She loved athletics and following her graduation she became a star player for a locally sponsored semi-professional baseball team prior to WW I. She loved spending time with her brothers and sister, be it work or play. Being the youngest still at home she lovingly assumed the responsibility with her sister Rose, of taking care of her mother following a stroke she had until her passing in 1952. It was during this time that she met Arthur and they started their life together. They were married on September 7, 1946, and had two children, Judy and Michael. Zella was proud and steadfast, quiet and selfless and what she couldn't fix with love, hard work, sacrifice, or sheer will she would turn to her Catholic faith, and her love and belief in God. The daily praying of her Rosary can only be assumed by her family as having a positive affect on each of their lives. The daily example of her boundless love, unselfish and forgiving kindness, and true caring will not be forgotten by her family and friends. Zella was a devoted daughter, sister, wife and mother. Among the many domestic talents she had, cooking, baking and gardening made her a superb homemaker. The daily recipients of her loving affection and support was her departed husband Arthur; daughter, Judy Smith and her husband Tim; son, Michael Pretzer and his wife Kimberley; and until her passing, her sister, Rose De Luca with whom she shared a lifelong friendship. She never hesitated to extend herself to all her brothers and sisters, their spouses, numerous nieces and nephews and their families. She took delight in the presence of children and they loved her in return. There was no equal as a Grandmother in the eyes of her granddaughter, Jennifer Foster and her husband John; granddaughter; Erin Smith; grandsons, Jeffrey Pretzer and Ryan Smith. With the addition of her two great-grandchildren, Lindsey and Christian Foster, Zella relished in having new little ones to spoil, teach and nurture in her traditional loving ways. Visitation will be held at Whitehurst, Suillivan, Burns and Blair, on Tuesday March 1, 2005 from 2:00 to 7:00 p.m. Recitation of the Rosary and a Mass of Christian Burial will be held at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Fresno on Wednesday, March 2, 2005, at 10:00 a.m. Interment will follow at Fresno Memorial Gardens.

In addition he was a member of the National Rifle Association, American Legion, and Auburn Alumni Association.He was most dedicated to the Greensboro First Presbyterian Church, having joined when he was 10 years old. He taught the men's Sunday school class for over 50 years and was an active Elder for over 50 years. He became Elder Emeritus in 2003. For a time his gravelly bass graced the choir. He once gave the sermon in the absence of the minister. His topic was beauty, and he somehow managed to get a coon dog into his lesson, much to the delight of the congregation.Pascal was a God-loving man who read the Bible every morning and prayed before going to milk cows. He had an appreciation of the outdoors that was reflected in his love of vegetable gardening, hunting, and working the land. He enjoyed sharing with others, and many people were recipients of good Jersey cream, vegetable bounties, shelled pecans, or jars of homemade jams or jellies from his own hands.Pascal was preceded in death by his parents; sisters and brothers-in-law, Virginia Lankford (Lewis) and Elizabeth Coyle (Jack); brother-in-law, James McCool; son-in-law, David Prince; and stepdaughter, Kathryn Bonds Summerville. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Taylor Bonds Tutwiler; sister, Rosalie McCool; brother, Strudwick Y. Tutwiler (Margie); son, Thomas A. Tutwiler (Marguerita); daughters, Marilyn Tutwiler and Pamela Tutwiler Richards (Matt); stepsons, James Bonds (Marikay), Mike Bonds (Joleane), Bruce Bonds, and Paul Bonds; many grandchildren, nieces, and nephews; and his very close friend, Charlie Nelson.Services were held 2 p.m. Saturday, June 30, 2012, at Greensboro First Presbyterian Church with Rev.

She was a retired New York State employee and a lifelong parishioner of St. Adalbert Roman Catholic Church where she was a member of the Rosary Society. Emily loved roses and cultivated them in her small, home garden and was an active member of the Schenectady Rose Society. Emily was preceded in death by her husband, Boniface; sisters, Sadie Filipek, Isabelle Maciejewski and Dorothy Corrigan; and brother, Edmund Filipek. Emily was born in Amsterdam, NY to the late Jozeph Filipek and Josepha Piurek Filipek. She grew up on Bartlett Street, attended Amsterdam public schools and graduated from the Wilbur Lynch High School (class of 1933) where she received history honors. In recognition of her award, she spoke at the commencement on the world impact of Russia. This was a remarkable achievement because she had to leave high school for a year to obtain a job taking care of children to help support the Filipek family. Upon graduation, Emily went to work at the Mohawk Carpet mills where she advanced to the position of setter. She married Boniface A. Grabicki in September 1939 and moved to Schenectady where she raised her family and resided for the rest of her life. Emily grew up knowing responsibilities. At age 10, she began to cook for her family, using a kerosene stove. This sparked her lifelong passion for cooking and baking which evolved into gourmet dinner and dessert creations that were greatly appreciated by her family and friends. She also had the responsibility of caring for her younger sister, Dorothy, while her parents worked in the mills. During the Korean War, Emily worked the second shift at GE; however, after being laid off, she took secretarial courses and obtained an entry level position with the New York State Public Service Commission in Albany, NY. She advanced to become the commission's chief receptionist, the position she held up to her retirement in 1979. She then began her new life with enhanced passion, exploration, and enjoyment which focused on the following endeavors: Gourmet cooking: Emily approached each dish with creativity and passion for excellence. Without question, Emily made the best pies on this side of the Rockies. Travel: With her husband, Boniface, she went to Hawaii; with her sister, Isabelle they went to San Francisco, the Rocky Mountains, British Columbia, Canada, and including her sister, Dorothy, they all went to Cape Cod during the summer. Emily also traveled to her grandchildren's high school and college graduations and weddings and spent time at the Outer Banks and the Adirondacks with her sons and their families. Family celebrations: Emily attended and rejoiced in every family event that occurred in life's path for her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Finally, dancing: Emily took up square dancing and loved ballroom dancing. At her grandchildren's weddings she was known as the Dancing Queen. Emily's life can be best described as Love of Family, Love of Husband and Love of God. Emily is survived by her sons: James M. & Valerie L. Grabicki of West Chester PA, and William R. and Joan C Grabicki of Niskayuna, NY, as well as nine grandchildren and 14 greatgrandchildren. Funeral services will be held Saturday morning, November 10, 2012, at 8:30 a.m. from the Leszczynski Funeral Home, 716 Crane St., followed by a Mass of Christian Burial 9 a.m. at the Church of St. Adalbert, 550 Lansing St., Schenectady.

John died at his residence in Great Falls, surrounded by his sisters and close family. John's family extends a warm invitation to friends to join the family for the funeral liturgy at noon on July 10, 2014 at St. Ann's Cathedral in Great Falls, with Father Oliver Doyle presiding. Immediately following Mass the family invites friends to a Celebration of Life, co-sponsored by the Kelley family and John's Walleye friends, at Tuffy's Sunset Inn, in Sun Prairie. A memorial service and Mass will be held in Butte at a later date. John was born July 31, 1944 in Ogden, Utah to Dr. J.E. Kelley, a Butte Optometrist, and Margaret Gaddie of Sugar City, Utah. John married Phyllis Spencer in 1965; they were wed for 19 years.John attended Catholic schools in Butte, starting with St. Ann's grade school, graduating from Butte Central in 1962 and from Montana State University in 1973 in Agricultural Science. John spent the first six years of his post college career as a Clinical Technician with the Lionhead Guest Ranch near Big Timber, where he became one of the few veterinary clinicians in the U.S., conducting embryo transplants to extend cattle genetics.John's early hobbies included hunting, fishing, snowmobiling as well as riding in rodeos. He loved bucking broncos, steer wrestling, and roping. After several years with Cooper Pharmaceuticals, John moved to Billings, then to Great Falls in 1992 to manage Western Ranch Supply, specializing in the use of pharmaceuticals to improve farming and ranching. Since his retirement in 2009, John dedicated his energies to the Walleyes mission; building fish habitats in Tiber and other reservoirs, teaching kids to fish as a way to stay off drugs, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. He was a strong advocate for the free fishing pole/free tackle box programs, helping distribute thousands of fishing poles to deserving kids throughout the state. During his tenure as President, John also strongly supported the fight against Invasive Species, an initiative also sponsored by Walleyes. He was a spokesman for this initiative, as seen on local TV public service announcements. These past few months while fighting cancer, John was inundated with visitors, calls and emails wishing him well. His incredibly unique sense of humor; his ability to form life long friendships; his dedication to doing the right thing for the right reasons as he was inspired to do as an altar boy, set John apart.Whether it is in the world of farming or ranching, hunting or fishing, recreation or conservation, friends or neighbors, he will surely be missed. John enjoyed very much the friendships he made during three terms as President of Walleyes Unlimited, Great Falls Chapter. He was currently serving as the President of the State of Montana Walleye Association. He lived according to principles such as: \"Do the right things for the right reasons. Keep fish and fishing alive. Make friends with everyone you meet.\"John is survived by his sisters, Colleen (Kelley) Murray and husband, Don of Eugene OR, and their children Julie Fulton, Sean, and Kevin and 7 grandchildren; Patricia (Kelley) Nicholls and husband Phil of Surprise, AZ, children Heather Nudo and Allison, and 2 grandchildren; Karren (Kelley) Hughs-Pasco of Henderson, Nevada, children Brian, and Chris Hughs, and 2 grandchildren; Michelle (Kelley) Franich and husband Jack of Black Diamond, WA, their children Jody, Jeff, and Megan, and 5 grandchildren and one great-grandchild; Denise (Kelley) Seilstad and husband Scott of Denton, their children Kelly Markovich, and Kendra; half-sister Kimberly (Kelley) and husband Loren LeFebre of Great Falls, her children, Zachary, Rebecca and Chay; and John's former spouse, Phyllis (Spencer) now of Big Timber.He is preceded in death by his parents; and son John Vance.In lieu of flowers, please make any donations to Walleye Unlimited Great Falls Chapter, P.O.

Bob was born in 1930, in Chicago, IL. He graduated from Tilden Technical High School in Chicago in 1947, and attended Cornell College in Iowa. His legacy lives on in his five children, Robert (Marianne), Gail (Stephen) Miller, Darrell (Lynn), David (Joanne) and Beth (Arthur) Huskey, fourteen grandchildren, and four great grandchildren. Bob is also survived by many other members of his extended family. Bob was preceded in death by his loving wife of 66 years, Charlotte (nee Boland), mother, Elizabeth Eggebrecht, and brothers, William and Clarence (Bud) Weick. Charlotte was the love of his life, and their marriage was an example to all who knew them. He began working in the Chicago stockyards at Swift & Company, a meat- processing company, in 1948. He worked his way up from loading trucks as a teenager to managing one of the largest plants in the company. His career began in Illinois and took him and his family to Ohio, New Jersey, Nebraska, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Bob was tapped by the company to turn underperforming plants into profitable ones. In 1992, he retired from his position as Plant Manager for Armour Swift-Eckrich. The Methodist Church was always a big part of Bob's life, where he often volunteered his time and effort. At a young age, he attended Morgan Street Methodist Church in Chicago, IL, where he met his future wife, Charlotte. With each move, Bob and Charlotte quickly established membership for the family at the local Methodist Church. On their final move back to Illinois, they became active members of the United Methodist Church of Geneva, in Geneva, IL. Participation in athletics was an ongoing part of his life, including competitive wrestling in high school and college. He worked as a summer ranch hand on the McFarland White Ranch in Montana in 1948. Bob had a special passion for golf having played many famous courses in the United States, Ireland, and Scotland. Over the course of twenty years, he enjoyed annual golfing trips with his three sons. Woodworking was his hobby, and he built many fine pieces of furniture, which are now in the homes of his children and grandchildren. Cars were a lifelong passion for Bob. As a young man, he was the go-to mechanic for the extended family. With a crank here and a tinker there, he could get an \"old jalopy\" engine running. He was faithful to the Chrysler brand throughout the years, and the purchase of his 1949 Chrysler Windsor brought him great enjoyment. That car was similar to the first car Bob and Charlotte owned in their early years together. The 1949 Chrysler was famous for participating in the Hawthorn Woods, IL, 4th of July parade and for taking family and friends on trips to the ice cream parlor. Throughout his travels, Bob made many treasured friendships that lasted a lifetime. With a ready smile and an outstretched hand, Bob touched all of those around him with his warmth and generosity of spirit. \"You Always Cared About People\" The family would like to thank the staffs of River Glen of St. Charles and Solace Hospice & Palliative Care, Inc. for the love and care that was given to Bob. A private service will be held for the family at Chapel Hill Gardens South Funeral Home & Cemetery in Oak Lawn, IL, and a celebration of life will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, the family would be honored if donations would be made in Bob's name to the Salvation Army, an organization that Bob held dear.",

        "obituary_text": "Anne Barksdale Cargill Anne Barksdale Cargill, 65, died on November 12, 2013, at her home in Charlottesville, Virginia after a two-year battle with brain cancer. Anne was born October 5, 1948, in Richmond, Virginia to the late James Nelson Cargill and Frances McDaniel Cargill. Anne is survived by her husband, the Rev. James Baker; three sons, Sam Baker and his wife, Jennifer Jones, of Los Angeles, California, and Nathan and Reuben Baker, both of Charlottesville; one brother, James Nelson Cargill Jr. and his wife, Gloria, of Newport News; two sisters, Nancy Cargill Vachon and her husband, Brian, of Montpelier, Vermont, and Dr. Sally Page Cargill, also of Montpelier; two sisters-in-law, Judie Alfrey and her husband, Carl, of Ocala, Florida and Janet Anderson and her husband, Terry, of Ft. Wayne, Indiana; and nine nieces and nephews. Anne grew up in Richmond and enjoyed spending time at her parents' summer place in Deltaville. She attended Collegiate School and spent many summers at Camp Alleghany in West Virginia as both a camper and a counselor. Anne was a graduate of Salem College, in Winston-Salem, N.C. and earned a master's degree in theology and ethics from Vanderbilt University. She married her husband Jim in 1973, and after spending two years at the American Church in Paris, they settled in Charlottesville, where Jim has served as pastor for the Westminster Presbyterian Church congregation for over 30 years. While raising their three sons, Anne worked as a travel agent for Enterprise Travel and in recent years for the Head Start program in Charlottesville. One of Anne's greatest joys was the time she spent at the \"river house\" on the Potomac, home of family friend Dr. John Owen. At the river, Anne loved sitting on the beach, reading, working on the house, entertaining her college friends, and eating seafood with her family. She also returned to Camp Alleghany on many occasions for reunions and to work towards providing camp scholarships. Anne loved singing camp songs and reminiscing with her friends, many of whom remained close companions in her final years. During her days at camp, Anne honed her shooting skills and became the National Junior Rifle Champion. Anne was passionate about travel, and she and Jim spent many happy times in South Carolina, England, Scotland, and France. Anne was a devoted member of Westminster Presbyterian Church. She served as a youth leader, organized a church tennis league, and loved visiting older members of the congregation, who eagerly anticipated her chocolate candy each Christmas. Anne could make conversation with anyone. Her sharp wit and self-deprecating manner helped others feel at ease. Her joyful outlook on life amused her husband, her many friends, and her three sons and daughter-in-law, who were the greatest joys of her life. Anne was a storyteller, and her family and friends joked that others could travel the world yet still couldn't compete with Anne's story about an ordinary trip to the grocery store. Anne's life \"story\" came to an end too quickly, but her grace and light will forever be interwoven with everyone she touched. The family wishes to thank Anne's many caregivers, especially Dr. John Owen, Dr. Karen Maughan, Joyce Green, and Connie Anderson, who unselfishly and graciously served Anne until the end of her days. There will be a memorial service to honor Anne's life on Saturday, November 23, 2013, at 2 p.m. at Westminster Presbyterian Church, 400 Rugby Rd., Charlottesville, Virginia with a reception to follow. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Camp Alleghany Scholarship Fund (checks payable to the Greater Greenbrier Valley Community Foundation, P. O. Box 1682, Lewisburg, WV, 24901); the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (Save the Bay, Capitol Place, 1108 E.

His passing was marked by the same qualities with which he lived his life: Faith, Trust, and Love in Christ. In his own words: Looking back on my life I can say it all started from, a gift, to me from God. He placed me in a family that was deeply Catholic. His Spirit guided me all through my life, even when I turned my back on Him, or did things that widened the gap between us. He never stopped loving me. Gerald was born to Leonard Peter Kipper and Margaret Sophie Egidy on July 10, 1936 in Oak Park, IL, a suburb of Chicago. He was the first of 7 children, being the older brother of Leonard, Joan, Lorna, Karen, Mary, and Sandy. From Oak Park his family moved to Richmond, KS and then to Kansas City. There he attended and graduated from Redemptorist High School.After graduation, Gerald went on to serve in the United States Army from 1955-1957. He was honorably discharged with the rank of Specialist Third Class, Artillery, Regular Army.He then attended and graduated from Central Technical Institute in Kansas City, and from there moved to Santa Maria to begin a 42-year career at nearby Vandenberg Air Force Base. At various points he worked on the base for General Dynamics, Lycoming Engines, and ITT / Federal Electric Company. During this time he also supplemented his credentials by attending and graduating from Allan Hancock College with an AS in Electronics, an AS in Data Processing, and an AA in Public Accounting. He retired from Vandenberg Air Force Base as a Systems Supervisor at Building 7380, where he oversaw launch timing and countdown.He lived in Orcutt and the Santa Maria area for the entirety of his adult life. He shared 36 years of marriage with his first wife Sharon Enyart Kipper, who preceded him in death. Gerald and Sharon together welcomed 5 children into the world with the birth of Kevin, Katrina, Jerry, Joyanne, and David. Their family grew with the addition of daughters-in-law Susan, Yvonne, and Amber, persons Gerald very much considered his own daughters.As a natural expression of his Faith and Love in God, Gerald was exceptionally involved with the community at St. Louis de Montfort Catholic Church from the beginning-even being present as a founding parishioner when the church was established in 1963. Gerald served as a Religious Education Teacher and Eucharistic Minister.

Her parents had been married for 9 years at the time she was born, and her name was chosen to commemorate the joy they felt at the birth of their first child. Gladys and her younger brother, Bob, grew up on a poultry farm and attended a rural one-room school, which she always remembered fondly. The two children lost their mother when Gladys was only 5, and their father 6 years later, and they were sent to live separately with relatives. Gladys lived mainly with her grandmother, Margaret Guy, in Bradford, PA.  Gladys graduated from Bradford High School in Bradford, PA in 1933. In the 30's she discovered a love for tennis, and eventually won the Bradford women's doubles city championship. She married the late Joseph McAmbley in 1940. After raising two children in Bradford and, later, in Warren, PA, the two were divorced in 1981. Gladys moved to California in 1985 to be near her daughter and family in Orcutt, Los Osos, and finally in Morro Bay, CA. Before her marriage, she worked as a bookkeeper for an oil supply business and for Pennsylvania Electric Co., where she met her future husband. When the children were both in school she worked for the Bradford Community Chest. After her move to Warren, PA in 1963 she worked in the business office of Warren General Hospital until her retirement in 1981.  Gladys was an active member of the First Presbyterian Churches of Bradford and Warren, PA, and belonged to the Orcutt Presbyterian Church after her move to California. She played bridge all her life, and loved to knit, read, cook and do crossword puzzles. As a parent and grandparent she was generous with her time and affection; she played an active part in the childhood of all 4 of her grandchildren. Gladys lived up to her name in many ways: she enjoyed small things, found meaning in the ordinary, dwelt on the positive, and enjoyed humor.  Gladys is survived by 2 children: Chris McAmbley (Bette) of Warren, PA; and Jean O'Carroll (Philip) of Morro Bay, CA. She is also survived by four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. She was preceded in death by her brother, Robert L. Frenz of Bradford, PA.  Donations in Gladys' memory may be made to Hospice Partners of the Central Coast, or to a charity of choice. A memorial service will take place on Sat., Aug. 27 at 10:00 a.m. at the First Presbyterian Church of Warren, PA. Burial will be at Saint Bonaventure Cemetery in Allegany, NY. ",

Patricia \"Pat\" was born and raised in Carver, July 30, 1939, and graduated from Plymouth High School in 1957. She was a loving daughter of the late Theodore and Amelia (Perry) Pina and one of nine children. Her career in nursing began at Taunton State Hospital. She worked tirelessly in healthcare as a dedicated and compassionate caregiver. She was a certified nursing assistant for over 45 years, most recently at Radius Healthcare in Plymouth for the past 20-plus years, where her impact was profound. Although raising seven children prohibited her from following her dream to become a registered nurse, her medical knowledge was comparable and respected by her peers. She loved to walk Plymouth's scenic waterfront, spend time with her seven children, 14 grandchildren, sisters, extended family and friends. She was extremely proud of her Cape Verdean heritage, spoke Creole and loved to attend annual Cape Verdean festivals. She enjoyed attending her grandchildren's school, recreational and organized events and was affectionately referred to as \"Nana\". Her legacy is her children whom she never stopped being a mother to and loving. Her strong will and determination instilled within her children the drive, focus and confidence to achieve their goals, tempered by her caring, compassion and love. She was the epitome of a strongly independent, loving mother and grandmother whose wonderful smile, humor and undying support will be greatly missed by her family. She is survived by her husband of 30 years, Thomas J. Smith. She was the loving mother of Robert M. Hunt, William D. Hunt III and his wife Kim, Lori A. (Hunt) Spencer, Alan J. Hunt, Tracey L. Hunt, Keith A. Hunt and Meclina M. Hunt and her partner Jeremy Murphy.

The youngest of three daughters born to Milton Lee and Alwilde Hanson Donaway, Dorothy grew up in Bellingham, Washington.Bellingham was an interesting place  Dorothy could watch the last of the tall ships in full sail from a hilltop overlooking Bellingham Harbor and the beautiful San Juan Islands.There were long walks in the woods and chasing the draft horses for riding bareback in the sawmill yard. In the summer, she jumped off the pilings and swam in the bay at the foot of the hill. On rainy winter days, the girls would clear the furniture out of an upstairs bedroom and go rollerskating. And when the Navy made Bellingham its 'port of call,' the neighborhood girls would dress up in their prettiest outfits to dance with the sailors at The Nebraska Club. All under the watchful eyes of the girls' mothers! Dorothy graduated from Fairhaven High School and then earned a degree in education from Bellingham Normal School, which today is Western Washington University. Teaching jobs were hard to get in the Depression, but Dorothy taught in Tekoa, Carnation and Pasco, Washington. Dorothy enjoyed a formidable reputation as a teacher. Parents would fight to get their children into her classes because they knew that their children would learn more. In Pasco, Dorothy met Roy W. Nelson, whom she married in February 1942. Dorothy and Roy loved to dance. During World War II, Dorothy traveled with Roy on his many deployments throughout the United States, but her favorite was Norman, Oklahoma, where she worked in the personnel department at the same Navy base where Roy was an aviation machinist's mate instructor.Three children were born to Dorothy and Roy: David, Marywilde and Britta Nelson-Maki. Education was a top priority in the Nelson household, especially in the performing arts. Dorothy loved music but was unable to realize her long-cherished goal to play the violin. So she made sure each child got a thorough music education. She never missed her children's performances. She also made sure her children were involved in scouting and exposed to concerts and ballet. Dorothy did what mothers everywhere do. She was the glue that held it all together  the motivating force that made it happen. Dorothy retired from the Pasco School District in 1976 and enjoyed a long retirement. She was an artist and loved to paint watercolors and oils. She assisted at polling places on election day, was active in Order of Eastern Star, and was a member of Women's Bible Study Fellowship and a member of Delta Kappa Gamma, a sorority for exceptional women in education. Dorothy and Roy were able to travel to Hawaii and to Sweden to visit relatives during retirement.Dorothy was preceded in death by her parents and two sisters, Bernice Hatfield and Alice-Jean Jorg, and her beloved husband, Roy. She is survived by her three children; three step-grandchildren, Lacey Ahlf, Eric Maki, and Dana Rognier; and numerous nieces and nephews.A private memorial service is pending. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to Lower Valley Hospice of Sunnyside, WA, or the charity of your choice, in Dorothy's name.",

        "obituary_text": "Williams, Bro. Queen Esther 8/15/1933 - 2/23/2018 Muskegon, MI Bro. Queen Esther Williams, age 84, departed this life at home on Friday, February 23, 2018. He was born on August 15, 1933 to Cleveland and Mary Williams in Utica, Mississippi. The Williams family moved from Utica to Muskegon, Michigan, when Queen was a young boy. He attended Muskegon Heights Public Schools where he participated in basketball and track. After graduating from Muskegon Heights Public Schools in 1952, Queen enlisted in the U.S. Army and bravely served our country in Korea until his honorable discharge two years later. Queen was affectionately known to some as Quincy E. What many might not know, is that prior to his birth, Cleveland and Mary believed they were having a baby girl and chose to name her Queen Esther. After delivering a healthy baby boy, his parents could not depart from the original name they had chosen and declared that would still be his name. After Queen was older, he took it upon himself to offer an alternative, thus taking on the name Quincy E. However, we can all agree that no matter what he was called, he was indeed the same man we all came to love and adore. Queen was married to Barbara Rhone and to this union two children were born - - Phyllis Starr and Andre Williams, Sr. As a very dedicated man, he also lovingly helped raise the Burt children, Anthony, Greg, Mark, and Linda McKee. He accepted Christ at a young age and attended Beulah Missionary Baptist Church under the leadership of the late Rev. Richard J. English. He served on Beulah's Usher Board until he became ill. Queen was a devoted Detroit Lions and Detroit Tigers fan! He also enjoyed watching countless episodes of \"Steve Harvey's\" Family Feud with his sisters, Clara and Hedesene. Lastly, he was a member of Muskegon's elite Brothers Eleven social club. Bro. Williams was a true entrepreneur. He bought and flipped homes to rent and/or sell while still maintaining full-time jobs at Continental and Kaydon Corp. He often worked multiple jobs to help support his immediate and extended families. After 40 years of dedicated service, Queen retired from Continental. Queen is survived by his loving children, Phyllis Starr of Muskegon, MI and Andre Williams, Sr. of Los Angeles, CA; three grandchildren, Brandi Sones of Grand Rapids, MI, Carl Sones III of Kalamazoo, MI, and Andre Williams II of Los Angeles, CA; three sisters, Tennie Lee Riley of Grand Rapids, MI, Clara Williams and Hedesene Fields of Muskegon, MI. He is also remembered by the Burt family, as well as a host of cousins, nieces, nephews, and friends. He was preceded in death by his parents, Cleveland and Mary Williams; his brother, St. Clair Williams, and sister, Mary McClendon. A celebration of life will be held on Saturday, March 3, 2018 at 11am at Beulah Missionary Baptist Church, James Williams, Sr., Pastor. Visitation will be held on March 2, 2018 from 2pm to 6pm at the church.",

The world doesn't get many folks like Elaine (known to family as \"Lainy\" or simply \"Grandma.\") Her love was unlimited, unwavering, and unconditional. A remarkable craftswoman, she could make (or mend) just about anything from clothing to cakes to carpentry. She didn't need a pattern or instructions \u2014 she could simply take an idea and make it real. To us it was magic. To her it came naturally.  Elaine served multiple terms as the Mayor of the town of Longton, KS where she left a lasting legacy \u2014 securing funding to overhaul the town's aging water system, successfully campaigning for a bond measure to fund a new addition to the high school, and organizing an annual town festival just for the joy of it.  Her favorite author, Terry Pratchett, once wrote: \"No one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away \u2014 until the clock he wound up winds down, until the wine she made has finished its ferment, until the crop they planted is harvested. The span of someone's life, they say, is only the core of their actual existence.\" By this measure she'll be with us for generations to come.  Elaine didn't want a funeral. She didn't want the sadness and tears. She wanted to hear laughter and see smiles. She wanted bright colors and joy. In her honor, let's seek that joy. Let's make the world kinder for her. Do those random acts of kindness that you read and hear about. She would feel so happy, so grateful, so peaceful to know the world got kinder and more joyful on her behalf!  GNU Elaine Parker",

She loved people absolutely and they loved her back. To all who knew her, and with great sadness, we announce Lindley's passing on the 18th of January, 2022.Lindley was born in Houston, Texas to Jane and Robert (Bob) Pond on October 26th, 1961. She came into life as bright and fierce as she left, touching, befriending and caring for people along the way. She attended University of Texas Dental Hygiene School and practiced 19 years as a successful hygienist in both Houston and Austin. Always interested in gardening and landscaping, Lindley began doing side jobs and favors for friends and acquaintances, until critical mass forced her to leave her dental instruments behind and start Lindley Pond Landscaping. Like Dental Hygiene, Lindley's love for people and talent for landscaping proved a successful combination as Lindley Pond Landscaping grew into a successful commercial and residential design and installation firm.During Lindley's career transition, her love of nature and animals led her to Johnson City where she planted her roots, set up shop and built her dream with horses, dogs, cats and chickens. Her landscaping business not only led her to lifelong relationships with customers, but also to Decker Ayers, the love of her life. Lindley and Decker were active in the Henly Baptist Church. As Lindley continued to mature in her faith-walk, she reached out to Don Forrester, her pastor and requested baptism as an expression of her Christian faith. Lindley started her day working the New York Times crossword puzzles in ink and feeding her horses treats from the steps of her house. She lived an active life managing her business, taking care of her animals, cooking and being a cheerleader, friend and confidant to the many family and friends in her life. She was an amazing daughter, sister, aunt and friend. Her positivity radiated everyday and to everyone lucky enough to cross her path.Lindley is preceded in death by her beloved husband, Decker Ayers, her mother Jane Pond and her grandparents. She is survived by her father, Bob Pond (Fran), brothers, Dr. Jay Pond of Fort Worth and Matt Pond (Megan) of Houston, numerous nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, cousins and countless great friends.A local remembrance will be held at the Henly Baptist Church, 200 Henly Loop, Dripping Springs, Texas, at 2:00pm March 5th, 2022. A celebration of Lindley's life will be held later in the Spring \u2013 the date to be announced.

        "obituary_text": "Loved and loving father, grandfather and uncle, George \"Ken\" Garrett died peacefully on Thursday, Aug. 20, at the age of 86 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease.  Ken was born and raised in Wichita Falls, Texas, and went on to study mathematics and electrical engineering at Midwestern State University and the University of Texas at Austin. An exceptionally strong swimmer and oilfield roughneck, he joined the Navy and served proudly during the Korean conflict.  Through mutual friends, he met the love of his life, Norma Louise Johnson, and they married shortly thereafter. After many different jobs and moves around the country, he made a career with IBM and settled in Pine Island.  Ken was deeply committed to his family and friends, and never tired of being known as Mrs. Garrett's husband. He was blessed with a keen sense of humor and intense curiosity. A tireless student of the game of golf, he was a self-proclaimed member of \"Arnie's Army.\" He enjoyed a long association with the Walleye Investment Club and counted its members as dear friends.  He and Norma retired to Red Wing, where she pursued numerous artistic projects, and he pursued errant golf balls. His greatest joy was cradling his new grandchildren and seeing them grow to young adulthood. He was a strong and compassionate caregiver, and nursed his wife and comforted his family through her long illness and passing. When health declines forced a move to assisted living, he truly missed the camaraderie of Alvina Street.  He is survived by his children, Jim and Ellie, and Jim's wife, Jane; his grandchildren, Conner and Allison; his loving companion, Dolores; and his nieces and nephews, Glen, Laurie, Genevieve, Ben, Connie and Ginger.

Most people called her 'Mommy,' as she delighted in sharing with many her Italian traditions filled with love and food. She was a simple woman of humble background and lived her life contented as a housewife and mother. Kay's earlier years were spent in New Jersey. It was on a blind date that she met Joe, who would be her husband for the next 63 years, until his death in 2011. They settled in Vero Beach where they raised their two children until Joe's retirement.  The next 22 years they were inseparable as they shared their golden years together; while living in Newberry, their home was often the 'gathering place' for family and friends. Through her actions, Kay demonstrated to those around her the meaning of dedication, commitment and self-sacrifice. Her home was the heart of her family, and her kitchen was the soul.  In their advancing years, they moved to Texas to be with their daughter JoAnn, until her death in 2013. Shortly thereafter, she moved to Tampa to live with her son and family. She is survived by her son, Joe (Marion); grandchildren, Mallory and Brian; a sister, Mary Cuthbert, and a brother, Frank Morano. A Funeral Mass will be held 11 am, Friday, March 4 at Incarnation Catholic Church (corner of Hillsborough Ave. and Webb Road). Kay will then be reunited with her husband at the National Cemetery in Dallas, TX. Please sign our online guestbook at: www.blountcurrywest.com",

Richard was born in New Haven, Connecticut on March 19, 1943 to the late Otis and Elinor Chapman. He grew up in Branford with his older siblings, Janice and Alan. One of Dick's most legendary feats was the day he decided to row across Long Island Sound from his home in Branford, Connecticut. He arrived that night on a beach in Long Island, New York and was taken in by a group of people he met at a bonfire. The next day he rowed back to Branford, and his mother thought he was missing because all she could see was an empty boat drifting with the oars up in the air. It turns out he was so exhausted, he had stretched out for a rest.He enlisted in the Army in 1964. He later sailed from Connecticut to Key West where he settled with his longtime partner Henri LaChapelle. Richard was employed as a civilian plumber for the Navy before he retired. He loved Ham Radios, warm weather and the ocean. Richard was a proud member of the Masons.Richard is survived by several nieces, nephews, grandnieces and nephews and one great-grandnephew.

The following year she founded Midland Festival Ballet as a non-profit performance outlet for her students. The production grew to a full-length version of \"The Nutcracker\" with live music from the Midland-Odessa Symphony and Chorale.

Jimmy, also known as Chago to his family, was born on July 25, 1956 in Los Angeles, California. When he was 11 years old, his parents moved the family to Guadalupe where Jimmy was a student at local schools then attended Ernest Righetti High School and received his GED later in life. For 28 years Jimmy worked as a fork lift operator at Guadalupe Cooling. Through the years he developed many wonderful friendships thanks to his charisma, charm and inability to pass up a get-together with people he cared about. His smile was contagious and he was very generous with it! Jimmy collected models and Homies figurines but in the months prior to his death his attention shifted to what mattered most to him: his family. He would spend hours piecing together collages from pictures that he had collected of family portraits and gatherings. His family was a vital portion of who he was but his 2 children were what truly brightened his world. The love and pride that he felt for them whenever he mentioned their names was tangible. It was obvious that he considered Matthew and Alina the greatest achievements of his life. He will be greatly missed by his family and friends. Jimmy is survived by his children: Matthew James Parra and Alina Nicole Parra both of Oahu, Hawaii; Sisters, Maria Antonia Sanchez (Miguel) of Bakersfield, Maria Elena Munoz (Francisco) of Santa Maria and Maryann Canas of Guadalupe; brothers: Roberto Parra Jr. of Guadalupe, Rogelio Parra (Frances) of Santa Maria and Anthony Parra of Guadalupe as well as numerous nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents: Roberto and Jennie Parra, his sister Rosemary Rodriguez and nephews: Miguel Sanchez Jr. and Jose Juan Sanchez. A rosary will be held on Friday, May 20, 2011 at 7:00 p.m. in Guadalupe at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church.

She is survived by her children, Katherine, William, Peter (Elizabeth Finegan), David (Kimberly O'Gorman), and John; and her grandchildren, Andrew, Emily, Kyle, Jake, Erin, Carly, Bobby, Sean, Daniel, and Cara. She was a graduate of Wellesley College, and the Harvard Graduate School of Education. She was a talented 7th grade English teacher for a number of years before turning her attention to raising her young children. Family was everything to Sally. Above all, she was a devoted wife, mother, mother-in-law, and grandmother. She took special pleasure in watching her children and grandchildren participate in their assorted sports and activities, and she showed genuine interest in their ongoing exploits. Sally loved to travel, and family trips, especially to the mountains of West Virginia or Lake George, New York, were of particular delight to her. Trips alone with Bud or together with their friends were frequent and meaningful to her. Sally was very active within the community. Born and bred in Cleveland, she loved the cultural vitality that the city has to offer, and she expressed that love by giving generously with her time to a number of charitable organizations. Arts education was a particular passion of hers because it blended together Sally's profound love for music with her devotion to education. She was also very active within the local Alcoholics Anonymous community for over 30 years, serving as a role-model, sponsor, and mentor to countless people. Sally was deeply spiritual. Plymouth Church of Shaker Heights was a uniquely special place to her, where she and Bud were married, where her children were baptized, and where she worshipped throughout the better part of her life. Selfless, eternally hopeful, and positive, Sally was a joy to be with. Her warm, calm, and smiling presence will be sorely missed by those who knew and loved her. In lieu of flowers, please consider making a memorial contribution to the Center for Arts-Inspired Learning, 10917 Magnolia Drive, Cleveland, OH 44106; The Music Settlement, 11125 Magnolia Drive, Cleveland, OH 44106, or Plymouth Church of Shaker Heights, 2860 Coventry Road, Shaker Heights, OH 44120 where a Funeral Service will be held on Friday, June 9 at 1:00 PM.

After several months battling congestive heart failure she left this world quickly while vacationing with family at a favorite state park in Virginia. Mary Lou was a graduate of Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk High School in 1971 and Nyack College in 1975. She and her husband were members of the Wycliffe Bible Translators and had lived, worked and raised their four children in Papua New Guinea for most of the 30 years of their married life. She was involved in providing support services (hospitality, post office, preschool and personnel) for the missionaries who worked at that remote station. Mary Lou is survived by her husband Steve and their children Ben (Maggie), Daniel, Nick and Julie; her parents, Chet and Joan Bolen; her siblings, Bruce (Katrina), Nancy, Jill (Rance), Bobby (Joanne), Jim (Pam), Melissa (Kevin), Wally, Cathy (Bill), Richard (Lisa), Chip (Lorraine) and Jennifer (Rob). Also surviving are many nieces, nephews and cousins. She was preceded in death by her sister Ginny. Mary Lou had a gift of hospitality and was able to put others at ease with her sense of humor and easy going nature. She loved her large family and many friends, but especially her Lord and those less fortunate than herself. She wanted to see others come to know her Savior, particularly those in Papua New Guinea with no access to the Bible in their own language.

Born in Los Angeles to Harold and Gwenda Neff in 1932, Don grew up in southern California where he developed an early love for automobiles and mechanics, an avocation that turned into a lifetime career. After a stint in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War era, Don entered the automotive and industrial supply industry, where he worked for decades as an engineer. His work took him and his family from California to New Jersey and Oklahoma before eventually settling in Annapolis fifteen years ago. Those who knew Don remember him as always laughing, telling captivating stories, sharing memories, and offering useful advice. He fixed everything in sight, from toasters to bicycles to cars: his grandkids called him \"Pop Pop Who Fixes.\" He is survived by his wife of more than 55 years, the former Karen Lee Zetsche; two brothers, Glenn of Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, and Paul of Newport Beach, California; two sons, Darrell of Bayville, New Jersey, and Kevin of Greenville, California, a daughter Jennifer Neff Macris of Annapolis, Maryland; eight grandchildren, and five great grandchildren.

Survived by his mother, Catherine Tanzola and her fiance, Dave Chicosky, brother, Nicholas Tanzola and his wife, Angela, sister, Tracy Tanzola, grandmother, Ann Musumeci, along with numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins. Predeceased by his father Kenneth, maternal grandfather Angelo Musumeci, and paternal grandparents, Dave and Dolores Tanzola. If you look in Webster's Dictionary for the definition of smile, it says \"a pleased, kind or amused facial expression usually showing friendliness.\" The first thing most people who knew Andrew remember or comment about is how he was always smiling. His smile lit up a room so bright you'd wish you had your sunglasses on. Look no further than Facebook or Twitter for comments from his friends and loved ones about what a kind, easy going, friendly soul he was who always liked to joke around and laugh. Friendliness was second nature for him. He was an avid fan of basketball (76ers), baseball (Phillies), and football (Steelers). He played basketball and football for the Clearview Youth Program and baseball for Mantua Township Little League, where he met and befriended countless good kids. The world will forever be partly cloudy without this ray of sunshine in it! He truly will be missed.

He died at home surrounded by his family, on Monday, April 6, after his battle with cancer. He was 70 years old. Everett was born to Everett Leslie and Anna Bernice Taylor on May 25, 1938, in Aberdeen, Wash. The family moved to Sweet Home when Everett was in the sixth grade. He graduated from Sweet Home High School. Upon graduation, Everett joined the United States Navy. After leaving the Navy, he worked in Washington on a commercial tugboat.

In 1966, the couple moved to Las Vegas, where Everett worked for the telephone company. While in Las Vegas, Everett enjoyed flying, and earned his private pilot's license. In 1976, the family returned to Oregon, where Everett worked for Pioneer Telephone Co-op. The family settled in Philomath, where they continue to reside.

His hobbies included taking his family camping and fishing. He was a talented woodworker and often built beautiful pieces for his family.

Bob graduated from Oklahoma State University with a Masters in Electrical Engineering and a wife named Michael Ann. A few short years later, Bob and Mike moved to Colorado and Bob went to work for Hewlett Packard where he would remain until he semi-retired 22 years later. Bob was born to be an engineer, but his real joy came from helping people, particularly kids. In the hospital for the birth of his son, Bob picked up a pack of 'twisty' balloons. He would spend the next 4 1/2 decades tying and giving away balloons across four continents and in more than a dozen countries. Balloons were always free, with the insistent directed to donate to Colorado Christian Home (later part of the Tennyson Center) or the local church. There were many stories of Bob simply helping people. Late one night - after a full day of setting up sound equipment for a concert in Estes Park - Bob was driving back to the motel for some much needed rest when he stopped to help an old school bus on the side of the road. 'Do you know anything about electricity?' A few hours later, Bob joined his family at the motel, the electrical system revived and the bus on its way. At First Christian Church in Loveland, he gave immensely of his time and talent. He was an Elder, a camp director, a Children's Sermon giver, and always 'The Balloon Man'. For Colorado Christian Home, he was a fierce champion for children who needed one. He raised money, helping others to understand the need, the duty, and the lives that could be touched. Bob is survived by his wife Michael Ann, sons Rob and Nathan, brother Bill, and three grandchildren. A belated service will be held later this year, date to be determined.

The cause of death was cardiac arrest, in the ambulance, on the way to the hospital. Uncle Bob was 77 years old and lived most of his adult life in Fairfax City, Virginia. He was born in Richmond, Virginia on July 15, 1938 to Anne and Robert Menefee. He grew up in Sperryville, Virginia, before graduating from East Carolina University and then serving in the US Army Reserve. A true baseball guy, he first taught and coached at Mount Vernon High School before moving to Robinson High School in 1971, where he taught and coached until he retired. The Robinson baseball field was named in his honor and remains that way today. A scholarship, in his name, was created several years ago to assist student/athletes at Robinson High School as they move on to college. This scholarship is still going strong today. Uncle Bob''s closest family were his brother Ed Menefee; sister-in-law, Shirley Menefee and their son, Robert L. Menefee. After Robert L. Menefee married Juana Mari Garcia in June of 2011, Uncle Bob developed a caring relationship with Mari''s two girls, Sofia 15 and Nicole 13. In his words, the last true love of his life was Robert and Mari''s daughter, Alina Lynn Menefee, four years old. She loved Uncle Bob and he never left without reminding her that \"Uncle Bob loves you\". Uncle Bob was a kind soul and peaceful man who always made those around him feel at ease. Uncle Bob''s quick wit and desire to laugh led many people to say \"he''s one of the funniest people I''ve ever met\"A Celebration of Uncle Bob''s Life will take place Thursday, December 17, 2015, at 10 a.m., at Belle Haven Country Club, in Alexandria, Virginia. No flowers or donations are necessary. Uncle Bob, as most know, liked to keep it simple and not burden anyone.

        "obituary_text": "Betty Jean \u201cGraston\u201d LutzShe was born Betty Jean Graston on May 23, 1932. To all those who knew her she was Jean, Betty was her first name that she hated, never knew why. To others beside Mike and myself she was \u201cMom\u201d. She took to our friends as if we were all one family.She finished High School at Arsenal Tech downtown Indy. She worked at the time was a \u201cFive and Dime\u201d store I thing it was Woolworths. She working in a Photograph Studio, and other clerical positions, one being at All State Insurance near Shadeland and Washington St. She later was hired by the Indianapolis Public Health Department. Retired from there in the late 70s or early 80s.Jean was a lady with a Big Heart. She had a love for animals both domestic and wild. She taught her boys the love and care for all kinds of creatures. The ones that were from the outdoors were loved and cared for before they were released back to the wild. I was told a story about myself when I found a mouse, that I named: Mickey Mouse, I thought he was sleeping and I ask if we could keep him? She convinced me that when Mickey woke up he would want to go home to his family. So, we put Mickey back outside and he must have awoken and went home, as he was nowhere in sight the next day. She once shared with me about a good friend who was travelling thru Alaska with his Dad. They stopped into the Forestry Campgrounds that Mom and Dad were a host at. Mom found out it was my good friends\u2019 birthday, and with supper that night she had made him a birthday cake. Those were some of the life lessons I loved my mom for, Love, Caring and Kindness. Those were some of the Life Lessons that made my brother Mike and I the men, we are today. There is one lesson that did CLASH with our Dads\u2019 Life Lessons. I will refer to it as \u201cWhen I get around to it\u201d. From time to time there were things that had a clock on them to be done. So, I would ask mom about the progress of that protectoral thing, her reply was, I\u2019ll get around to it. Myself being the \u201cpoop\u201d and \u201cjokester\u201d, I got a wooden coin at the State Fair that had the words printed on it \u201cAround 2 It\u201d. So, the next time I received that answer. I pulled that wooden coin from my pocket, and handed it to her. That\u2019s about all of that story I wish to share.When we would say good bye from a visit or phone call she would almost always say: \u201cI love you and Keep my nose clean\u201d. On a call to her from overseas at the end of the conversation she gave me her normal advice, \u201cI love you and Keep your nose clean\u201d. This time I replied \u201cYes mom, I\u2019m picking it now\u201d. She then calls me a\u201d Shitass\u201d and we both laughed and ended the call. I will always remember those special moments in life.As life often does, it comes to those final days of our life journey. I went to see her on the 25th of April, she was sleeping a lot and you just felt that time to go, home was near. I whispered to her it was OK and Dad was waiting on her. A couple of days later Mike was visiting the night before she passed, he also told her Dad was a little concern that she was taking to long. He told her it was OK and he had THIS, and things would be alright. The next morning on April 29, 2023 she was home with Shorty, just a little over 5 months from his passing. Those who knew my Mom and Dad, I know will miss them, and I already do",

Joe was born on Dec. 12, 1925, in the Town of Sheboygan, the fifth of nine children, born to Martin and Katherine (Schmitt) Block. His Plymouth family would be forever altered by the tragic death of his father in 1941. The economic hardship spurred by his father's death redefined education and family life for him. On March 29, 1952, he married the love of his life, Marilyn Clemens, in Plymouth. Together they built their marriage and made their home in rural Sheboygan Falls. Joe worked for Hydro Excavating, but he most fondly remembered the camaraderie of the folks in the Maintenance Department at Bemis Mfg., where he was employed for 19 years until his retirement in 1997.Joe enjoyed stock car racing and football. A man of few words, his twinkly blue eyes and boyish grin spoke volumes. Slight in stature, but long on grit and determination, Joe had the uncommon gift of being wholly content being at home in his yard. On any given sunny day he could be found sitting in his chair in front of the garage watching cars go by.Joe is survived by his wife, Marilyn; one daughter, Kristi Schuchardt (Dale), Sheboygan; two sons, Steven (Darlene) Block, Sheboygan Falls; and David Block (Leesa), Plymouth; six grandchildren, Zachary and Rebecca Schuchardt, Abby Dotz (Ryan), Elizabeth (Ron) Rekowski, Emily Block and Joseph Block; one great-grandson, Marcus Rekowski; two sisters, Leona Gilboy, Plymouth; and Mary Ann Verhage, Sheboygan; one brother, Raymond (Mary) Block, Cleveland; and two brothers-in-law, Edward (Mary) Brinkman, Lakewood; and Jerry Brinkman, Plymouth.Joe was preceded in death by his parents; two sisters, an infant, Hildegarde Block and Helen (Willard) Brendel; three brothers, Leonard \"Red\" (Lorraine), Herbert (Patricia), Robert \"Curly\" (Sandra) Block; two brothers-in-law, Norbert Gilboy and Lawrence \"Hap\" Verhage; and a sister-in-law, Carol Brinkman.A private family memorial service will be held at the Chapel of Eternal Light.For online condolences and additional information, please visit www.wenigfuneralhome.com.

Bill was born November 23, 1937, in Binghamton, New York to Albert E. and Lillian L. (Roy) Parson. After high school Bill attended the New York State Ranger School - State University College of Forestry Syracuse University. Soon thereafter he jumped on a westbound train matriculating at the University of Idaho, graduating with a degree in Forestry. Bill then joined the United States Maring Corps in 1961, becoming a Naval Aviator piloting his beloved A-4 Skyhawk and serving nearly 6 years in active duty which included a 9-month tour in Vietnam where Bill spent several harried nights in the jungle after his surveillance plane crashed during a mission into the side of a mountain due to severe weather during monsoon season. Bill was honorably discharged from the United States Marine Corps in 1966, achieving many flight qualifications including flight instructor at Cherry Point, NC, and Weapons Handler & Nuclear Weapons Currier. His military awards include Air Medal with Gold Star, Vietnamese Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and Vietnam Campaign Medal. Following military service Bill headed West yet again putting his degree to direct use working for 30 years in the forestry business in Montana beginning with Burlington Northern Railroad and ending his distinguished civilian career as Director of Resources for the Rocky Mountain Region with what evolved into BN Timberlands and then Plum Creek Timber Company (now present-day Weyerhaeuser). Upon Bill's retirement in 1995 he was awarded \"The Grandfather of Environmental Forestry\" distinction for leading efforts in resource innovation, repurposing production waste byproducts, and meeting the increasing demands in responsible forestry. Bill's love of flying and airplanes followed him into civilian life; completing the complicated blueprint build of a tail drag airplane from scratch in 1980 while living in Bozeman; and building a designed for kit construction high wing, strut braced Avid Flyer completed in 1993. He fearlessly piloted these experimental homebuilt aircraft well into his later years in both the Gallatin and Flathead Valleys. He proudly and passionately served as Director of the USAF Thunderbird Airshow held here at Glacier Park International Airport in the early 90's and relished the opportunity to expose an endeavor he found so exhilarating to the younger generation in the Flathead Valley and to all his fellow Montanans. There was seemingly nothing Bill couldn't do when he put his mind to it. If he was in your corner, you unquestionably had an advocate you could count on. He enjoyed challenging himself regularly, as well as anyone sturdy enough to join him --- be it on hikes atop Glacier's highest peaks, within the Bob Marshall Wilderness, and Montana forests --- to Alaska moose and caribou hunts, to flying into remote areas, racing sailboats on Flathead lake out of North Flathead Yacht Club where he served a term as Commodore in 1997; or planning travel to the likes of Germany, New Zealand, Honduras, the Ambergris Caye, Belize, trekking Copper Canyon Mexico on bike and foot, or sailing adventures throughout the Caribbean and Virgin Isles. Planning such adventures, spending time with his family and making memories while doing so was what it was all about to Bill. An avid sportsman and outdoorsman; his hobbies too numerous to list included shooting trap, sailing, downhill skiing, and spending time on Hungry Horse Reservoir; but spending a lifetime successfully chasing the elusive wapiti and packing out elk himself well into his late 70's was undoubtedly his favorite Montana memory making activity. Bill is preceded in death by his parents, his older Brother Albert C. \"Al\" Parson, his Niece, Darci Parson and numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins. Bill is survived by his three children, Jennifer Marie Parson (Braley), William Joseph Parson, Jr., Christopher Albert Parson, his wife Stephanie, and their daughter Hailey, all of Kalispell, MT; as well as his Brother Brian D. Parson, wife Marsha and their family out of Missoula and Troy.",

Pauline went to college receiving her teaching certificate and taught children in a one room schoolhouse before relocating to California where she continued her teaching career for many years while also working alongside her husband at Stillwell Upholstery Shop. Even after her retirement, Pauline devoted her time to children who needed help with reading, hand printing hundreds of phonics cards and books for each and every one of her young students.

She is survived by her husband of 61 years Harvey, and her children Terri Kramer and her partner Neil Malkin and Bob Levitt and his wife Robin. She also leaves her grandchildren Melanie (Kramer) and her husband Colin Willis, Rebecca Kramer, Ryan Levitt and Morgan Levitt. Born in Hartford, CT, she was the daughter of the late Sidney and Betty Zucker Kadish. She was predeceased by her older sisters Marion Greenberg and Ruth Kadish. Graduating from Weaver High School in 1957, Harvey and Arline were King and Queen of her Senior Prom. She worked for over 25 years in the insurance industry for Aetna and Fireman's Fund. After retirement, she and Harvey moved to The Villages in Florida in 2005 enjoying their life there immensely taking advantage of all that the amazing community had to offer. She was a proud member of Temple Shalom Sisterhood and became a Bat Mitzvah at the age of 73. She loved to play Mahjong every week with a very close and wonderful group. They enjoyed traveling especially going on cruises with their many friends from The Villages. She was fiercely loved by her children, grandchildren and extended family who would argue that she was the most beloved woman on the planet. Some of her fondest memories were made at the Connecticut shore with her grandchildren where she would make the best dolly bars and potato salad that could be found anywhere. She had a special place in her heart for her neighborhood friends on Patrick Place. People were drawn to her because of her boundless and truly genuine kindness creating an extraordinarily large circle of friends. To meet Arline was to become her friend and she could always be counted upon for anything. The family wishes to extend a special thank you to Steve and Cindy Greenberg for their invaluable and loving care and assistance. In lieu of flowers, donations should be directed to the Alzheimer's Association, alz.org.",
